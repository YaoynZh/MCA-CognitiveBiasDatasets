# MCA-Cognitive-Bias-Datasets
This repository contains three collections of logical reasoning questions sourced from the GRE, LSAT, and SHS exams. Each collection is designed to assess critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills across different educational levels.

## SHS Dataset

The **SHS Dataset** is sourced from the official website of the New South Wales Government Education Department ([NSW 2024 SHS](https://www.nsw.gov.au/education)). It is designed for high school placement tests and focuses on assessing various thinking skills. The dataset specifically includes questions from the **Thinking Skills** section of the SHS test, which is one of the four sections of the exam, alongside `Reading`, `Mathematical Reasoning`, and `Writing`.

### Dataset Overview

The **Thinking Skills** section of the SHS test assesses four key thinking abilities:

- **Computational Thinking**: Evaluates the ability to decompose problems, recognize patterns, abstract, and design algorithms.
- **Design Thinking**: Focuses on identifying needs, creating innovative solutions, and considering economic, environmental, and social impacts.
- **Scientific Thinking**: Enhances knowledge through scientific methods such as posing questions, designing experiments, analyzing data, and drawing evidence-based conclusions.
- **Systems Thinking**: Requires understanding and analyzing the interactions and overall functions of complex systems.

The dataset consists of **97 multiple-choice questions** in **pure text format**. Each question presents information followed by four possible options for selection. For clarity and consistency, questions related to geometric reasoning were removed, focusing solely on the core reasoning aspects and eliminating potential errors caused by multimodal data (e.g., mixed images and text).

### Problem Example

The **Berruga lizard** and **Indora lizard** are very similar. The only major difference between the two species is their diet:
- **Berrugas** mostly eat termites and ants, but they will occasionally eat other insects, and even things like snails.
- **Indoras** will eat almost anything if they are hungry, and they especially like termites, but they never eat ants (and in fact, ants are poisonous to Indoras).
Keira and Jun have rescued an injured lizard, and they want to find out which species it is.
- **Keira**: "If we only feed it termites, we’ll be no closer to knowing whether it’s a Berruga or an Indora."
- **Jun**: "The only way that we could know for certain would be to give it some ants."
If the information in the box is true, whose reasoning is correct?
- **A** Keira only
- **B** Jun only
- **C** Both Keira and Jun
- **D** Neither Keira nor Jun
