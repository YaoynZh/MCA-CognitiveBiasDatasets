# MCA-CognitiveBiasDatasets
This repository contains three collections of logical reasoning questions sourced from the GRE, LSAT, and SHS exams. Each collection is designed to assess critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills across different educational levels.

## SHS

The **SHS Dataset** is sourced from the official website of the New South Wales Government Education Department ([NSW 2024 SHS](https://se-practice.au.insights.janison.com/pages/shs.)). It is designed for high school placement tests and focuses on assessing various thinking skills. The dataset specifically includes questions from the **Thinking Skills** section of the SHS test, which is one of the four sections of the exam, alongside `Reading`, `Mathematical Reasoning`, and `Writing`.

The dataset consists of **97 multiple-choice questions** in **pure text format**. Each question presents information followed by four possible options for selection. For clarity and consistency, questions related to geometric reasoning were removed, focusing solely on the core reasoning aspects and eliminating potential errors caused by multimodal data (e.g., mixed images and text).

### Problem Example
```text
The Berruga lizard and Indora lizard are very similar. The only major difference between the two species is their diet:
- Berrugas mostly eat termites and ants, but they will occasionally eat other insects, and even things like snails.
- Indoras will eat almost anything if they are hungry, and they especially like termites, but they never eat ants (and in fact, ants are poisonous to Indoras).
Keira and Jun have rescued an injured lizard, and they want to find out which species it is.
- Keira: "If we only feed it termites, we’ll be no closer to knowing whether it’s a Berruga or an Indora."
- Jun: "The only way that we could know for certain would be to give it some ants."
If the information in the box is true, whose reasoning is correct?
A. Keira only
B. Jun only
C. Both Keira and Jun
D. Neither Keira nor Jun
```

## LSAT

The **LSAT Dataset** is sourced from the official resources provided by the **Law School Admission Council (LSAC)** ([2024 LSAT](https://app.lawhub.org/library/drillsets.)), designed for law school admission. The **LSAT** focuses on the **Logical Reasoning** section, which is intended to assess a broad range of critical thinking skills essential for legal reasoning. The content of the questions comes from diverse sources, including newspapers, magazines, scholarly publications, advertisements, and informal discussions. These questions aim to reflect the types of arguments and complexities encountered in legal reasoning, though most are not directly related to law.

The **LSAT Dataset** are purely textual, with no additional processing required. The dataset contains **14 sets of questions**, each containing **12 questions**, resulting in a total of **168 questions**. Each logical reasoning question follows a fixed structure: candidates are required to read a short passage and answer one question based on it. Every question provides five answer choices, but only one is correct.

### Problem Example
```text
The use of crops that have been genetically altered to enhance yields and reduce susceptibility to pests, droughts, and disease is unlikely to reduce the problem of widespread food shortages. The problem is less one of supply than of efficient distribution of the more-than-adequate supplies that already exist. More food is produced per person in the world today than has ever been produced before in recorded history.
The claim that the problem of widespread food shortages is less one of supply than of efficient distribution of the more-than-adequate supplies that already exist plays which one of the following roles in the argument?
A. It presents the view against which the argument is being made.
B. It supports the main conclusion of the argument and is itself supported by another claim.
C. It is the main conclusion of the argument.
D. It is a generalization from which the argument draws two distinct but related conclusions.
E. It is an elaboration of the argument's main conclusion.
```

## GRE
The **GRE Dataset** is derived from the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE), a standardized test used for graduate school admissions in the United States. The GRE consists of three main sections: **Verbal Reasoning**, **Quantitative Reasoning**, and **Analytical Writing**. This dataset focuses on the **Verbal Reasoning** section, specifically the logical reasoning questions. We have sourced the logical reasoning questions from GRE practice materials provided by two well-known GRE preparation agencies in China ([Zhenjing GRE](http://www.grepass.vip.)) and ([Qingshan GRE](https://www.eduqingshan.com.)). These questions were collected from actual GRE computer-based exams, totaling **332 questions**.

Each Verbal Reasoning section contains at least one logical reasoning single-choice question. These questions consist of a brief passage followed by a question where the candidate must select the most appropriate answer from five options. The questions typically address non-academic topics, including social issues such as news reports, societal phenomena, and policy discussions. They are designed to test the ability to analyze and evaluate the arguments and logic within these topics.

### Problem Example
```text
Patel: Although enrollment in the region's high school has been decreasing for several years, enrollment at the elementary school has grown considerably. Therefore, the regional school board proposes building a new elementary school. 
Quintero: Another solution would be to convert some high school classrooms temporarily into classrooms for elementary school students. 
Which of the following, if true, most helps to support Quintero's alternative proposal? 
A. Some rooms at the high school cannot be converted into rooms suitable for the use of elementary school students. 
B. The cost of building a high school is higher than the cost of building an elementary school. 
C. Although the birth rate has not increased, the number of families sending their children to the region's high school has increased markedly. 
D. A high school atmosphere could jeopardize the safety and self-confidence of elementary school students. 
E. Even before the region's high school population began to decrease, several high school classrooms rarely needed to be used.
