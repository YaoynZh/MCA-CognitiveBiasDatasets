"To prevent household theft, anticrime experts often advocate taking such inexpensive measures as increasing outdoor lighting or installing deadbolt locks on doors, instead of installing expensive alarm systems. Although these measures do not make it significantly more difficult to gain forcible entrance, they often are an effective deterrent nonetheless.

The situation described above most closely conforms to which one of the following generalizations? 
A. Homeowners prefer expensive modifications to inexpensive modifications. 
B. The problem of household theft will be solved through the adoption of inexpensive measures. 
C. Inexpensive options and expensive options are equally effective. 
D. Criminals are often not clever enough to overcome even minor obstacles that they encounter.

"For shepherds, using llamas for guarding sheep is cheaper than using dogs. To be sure, purchasing a llama can cost $300 more than an appropriate dog. But guard dogs require a year of training, and about half of all guard dogs are lost to disease or accidents before the age of three. On average, llamas live much longer than dogs, and they require no more than a few days of training. Finally, dogs are expensive to feed, whereas llamas graze on the same land as the sheep.
The reasoning in the argument above is least similar to the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
A. It is cheaper in the long run to buy a more expensive watch than to buy a cheap one, since a more expensive one will last much longer.
B. An energy-efficient refrigerator is more expensive in the short term, but because of the energy savings is actually cheaper in the long term.
C. Employers are well-advised to hire people who have experience, even if recruitment costs are higher, because the increased productivity will more than offset the higher costs.
D. The new air-conditioning agents being used in place of CFCs are more difficult to produce, but they are safer for the environment, so CFCs should be phased out.
E. Buying laundry detergent in large quantities requires a larger outlay initially, but is actually less expensive per wash, and thus cheaper in the long run.",D
"Drivers who claim that it is dangerous to have so many trucks on the highways are being alarmists. Examine your nearest shopping mall. Does it have an airstrip, boat dock, or rail spur? Probably not. People are dependent on trucks yet claim that they are dangerous.
A reasoning flaw in the argument is that the argument:
A. appeals to popular opinion
B. fails to distinguish between large trucks and small trucks
C. does not assess the economics of alternate shipping methods
D. does not actually address the potential dangers of trucks
E. fails to consider that many shopping malls are not near highways",D
"For millions of years the spider Latrodectus mactans has possessed remarkably toxic venom. Because much weaker toxins would still be fatal to all of the spider's prey, no evolutionary advantage results from the extreme potency of its venom. Therefore, it can reasonably be concluded that the extreme toxicity of Latrodectus mactans's venom is genetically linked with traits that are advantageous.

Which one of the following principles, if valid, provides the strongest support for the inference above?
A. If a trait that is disadvantageous is preserved for a long time in a species, the traits with which it is genetically linked are probably advantageous.
B. A trait that neither hinders nor helps survival will probably be extinguished if it is genetically linked to traits that are disadvantageous.
C. All traits that are preserved for a long time in a species are likely to be advantageous.
D. A trait will probably not survive for long in a species if neither it nor the traits with which it is genetically linked are advantageous.
E. Only those traits that survive in a species for a long time are likely to be advantageous.",D

"In an attempt to reduce spending on highways, researchers are trying to develop technology that will regulate highway tolls according to how heavy the traffic is. This technology would cause traffic to become more evenly spread out over the course of a day than it is now. Therefore, if this technology is developed, the amount of money that will have to be spent on construction of new highways will decrease.

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
A. The increased speeds at which people will drive because of the more evenly spread out traffic will enable some people to live farther away from work than they now live.
B. If highway traffic during peak volume periods is reduced, then some people who used to commute to work via mass transit will begin to drive to work on highways.
C. The number of lanes a new highway needs is more strongly dependent on the peak amount of traffic it is expected to carry than on the average amount it is expected to carry.
D. Using only the technology that exists now, it is possible to charge higher highway tolls during the times of day when traffic is usually heavier.
E. Most of the people who currently commute to work on highways during peak volume periods work for employers that offer them very little, if any, flexibility in the hours they work.",C
"Doctors have long known that high blood-triglyceride levels render a person more likely to contract heart disease and that adequate metabolization of polyunsaturated fatty acids tends to reduce triglyceride levels. Recent research shows that certain margarines and other products made from hydrogenated vegetable oils have a high trans-fatty acid content and consequently interfere with adequate metabolization of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Which one of the following is most supported by the statements above?
A. Hydrogenating vegetable oils increases the amount of trans-fatty acids they contain.
B. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are less of a risk factor for heart disease than are trans-fatty acids.
C. Certain kinds of fats are adequately metabolized only when certain other kinds of fats are present.

"Dinosaurs inhabited nearly every part of the earth for approximately 150 million years—time enough for hundreds of different kinds of dinosaurs to evolve and adapt to different habitats. They vanished 65 million years ago during a mass extinction that marked the end of many species of plants and animals on land and sea. It is surprising, then, that some scientists attribute the dinosaurs' extinction to the emergence of flowering plants, claiming that the herbivorous dinosaurs starved to death because they were unable to digest such plants.

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why the flowering-plant explanation of the dinosaurs' extinction is weak?
A. Flowering plants began emerging throughout the world at about the same time.
B. Whatever caused the dinosaurs' disappearance probably could not have caused the disappearance of other plants and animals during the mass extinction.
C. Flowering plants emerged gradually, so dinosaurs likely would have evolved and adapted, given their ability to adapt.

"In dealing with new employees, it is best for the training and the evaluation to be done by different people. If the same person does both, then to evaluate a new employee's performance unfavorably would be to evaluate one's own training skills unfavorably.

The principle underlying the reasoning most closely resembles the principle underlying the reasoning above in:
A. In selling automobiles it is best when one salesperson initially approaches the customer and another closes the sale. That way, salespeople's training can be tailored to specific tasks.
B. In assigning combat units to the front lines of a battle, it is best for the decision to be made by someone other than the units' commanding officers, because the commanding officers have only a limited perspective on the battle.

"Research has shown that when the calorie consumption of each member of a random group of animals belonging to the same species is restricted, some of the animals live longer than any animals of that species have lived on their normal diets. In contrast, reducing the incidence of illness in a group of animals merely results in an average life span higher than that of a group with a normal incidence of illness, and not in life spans exceeding the previous maximum life span. This research proves, therefore, that calorie restriction slows the aging process while reducing the incidence of illness does not.

The argument depends on assuming which one of the following?
A. Researchers have been unable to find any differences in the general susceptibility to illness of individual animals of the same species.
B. A reduced-calorie diet is the most effective method for increasing the average life span of a group of animals.
C. Life spans exceeding the previous maximum for a species indicate that the aging process has been slowed in the animals of that species who attain those life spans.
D. Any change in the aging processes of animals of a particular group will lead to a change in the incidence of illness in that group.

"Dietitian: To control blood cholesterol by dietary means, consuming oils low in saturated fats is much more effective than merely limiting dietary cholesterol. All oils that are solid at room temperature are high in saturated fats, but canola, an excellent high-temperature cooking oil, is liquid at room temperature. Thus, it is a good oil to use for those who wish to control their blood cholesterol.

The dietitian's reasoning is flawed in that it:
A) fails to consider that while a certain method of achieving an objective may be more effective than a certain other method, the two methods combined may be more effective than either method alone.
B) takes for granted that a certain characteristic that normally accompanies another characteristic is present only if accompanied by that other characteristic.
C) takes for granted that controlling blood cholesterol is a more effective method of achieving cardiovascular health than other methods are.

"Logan: Infrared thermography, which creates images that indicate locations of escaping heat, is an entirely nonintrusive detection process. Using this investigative tool on a building is a lot like sifting through discarded trash for clues, since both methods involve examining something that is open to public scrutiny.

However, in a study, 93 people of a representative sample of 100 adults were each, while isolated, seen by hidden observers to laugh upon being tickled by a mechanical tickling device. Thus, the longstanding belief about the conditions under which the sensation of being tickled tends to cause laughter is incorrect.

A) The psychologist's definitions of ""tickling"" and ""laughter"" are the same as the research subjects' definitions. 
B) At least some of the research subjects who laughed would ordinarily have laughed if knowingly tickled by another person with the same vigor as that which the mechanical device tickled them.

D) Some of the expensive equipment that was stolen from university campuses during the last academic year was old and in need of repair.
E) Some of the expensive equipment that was bolted down was vandalized rather than stolen.",A
"Nakagawa: When making business decisions, we who manage the company are obliged to take into account the public interest as well as normal business concerns like efficiency and expense. 
Gauldin: I disagree. Our obligation to the company's stockholders requires us to choose the most profitable course of action allowable by law without regard for public interest.
Nakagawa's and Gauldin's remarks provide the most support for holding that they disagree about the truth of which one of the following statements?
A. Managers usually try to maximize profit without regard for public interest. 
B. Managers should always do whatever their companies' stockholders want them to do. 
C. Managers should choose to pollute the environment if it is legal and more profitable than not doing so. 
D. Managers should never do what the public wants them to do. 
E. Managers should give equal weight to both profit and public interest in making business decisions.",C
"Criminologist: Dr. Ashton claims most people are not responsible for the crimes they commit because of the exploitative nature of the economic system in which they live. He alleges there is empirical evidence of this. His argument may be dismissed since it is exactly what one would expect given Dr. Ashton's political views.
Which one of the following exhibits reasoning most similar to the flawed reasoning exhibited by the criminologist's argument?
A. Dr. Catalan's case against this proposal should be dismissed. His case proceeded merely by attacking the character of the sponsor of the proposal. 
B. Dr. Ramirez's argument that a new road should be built downtown is unacceptable. If she is allowed to have a new road built today, tomorrow she will want a new parking lot, then a new mall, and soon the town's beautiful surroundings will be covered with cement. 
C. Dr. Narayan argues that there are estimates of traffic volumes that show that the proposed new highway is unnecessary. But we would expect such an argument from Dr. Narayan since he generally believes that no new highways should be built. Thus, his argument merits no consideration. 
D. Dr. Eton's testimony about the footprints found at the crime scene is dubious. She is a close friend of the defendant and so her credibility as a witness at the inquest is suspect. 
E. Dr. Makeba's claim that the universe is already collapsing is based on her own unusual explanation of cosmic background radiation. However, since this explanation is highly controversial, her claim should not be accepted without further investigation.",C
"In classic mystery stories, master criminals are captured through the genius of a detective working alone; but in one type of modern detective story—the police procedural—criminals are pursued by uninspired though hardworking people who employ the same mind-numbing routine each day. Hence, the development of the police procedural is an endorsement of the effectiveness of bureaucracies rather than individuals.

Each of the following, if true, provides evidence against the conclusion drawn in the argument except:
A. In police procedurals, there is often one member of the force, more clever than the rest, who does the most important work in catching the criminal. 
B. In police procedurals, criminals often go uncaptured because of the ineptness of the law enforcement agencies responsible for pursuing them. 
C. In police procedurals, criminals are often captured when the police are the beneficiaries of critical evidence that turns up during routine investigations. 
D. In police procedurals, crimes are often solved when the normal routine is broken. 
E. In police procedurals, members of the force are often portrayed as defying the rules by which their department is run.",C
"Journalist: Those of us acquainted with the work of filmmaker John Dowland are convinced that the accusations made against him of tax fraud and other financial dishonesty are baseless, for we know intimately the honesty and integrity that pervade his art—art that is notably uncommercial.

Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the journalist's argument?
A. It fails to provide a definition of the terms ""honesty"" and ""integrity."" 
B. It fails to show that only those who produce art pervaded with honesty are honest artists. 
C. Its claim that the filmmaker's art is uncommercial does not prove that the films did not yield significant taxable profits. 
D. It fails to show that John Dowland was not also involved in commercial ventures. 
E. It fails to justify its presumption that personal dishonesty and artistic honesty are incompatible.",E
"Olivia: Democracy in ancient Athens led to an unstable political climate, but Athenian democracy was very different from contemporary democracies. Contemporary democracies have corrected the flaws in the ancient Athenian system. Karl: On the contrary, it should be obvious that contemporary democracies retain the defects of the ancient system. After all, many social problems—crime, unemployment, and poverty, to name a few—are common in democratic countries today.
The reasoning in Karl's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it:
A. overlooks the possibility that crime, unemployment, and poverty are common in countries that lack democratic forms of government. 
B. presumes, without providing justification, that crime, unemployment, and poverty were the only problems common in ancient Athens. 
C. overlooks the possibility that many contemporary societies are already taking steps to reduce their rates of crime and unemployment. 
D. fails to show that the problems with current political systems are worse than the problems with the ancient Athenian political system. 
E. overlooks the possibility that the social problems common in democratic countries today are not due to defects in those countries' political systems.",E
"Although annoying and a serious waste of paper, postal junk mail does not interfere with the recipient's mail service. By contrast, a large amount of junk e-mail can overload a recipient's e-mail service so that none of the recipient's e-mail is accessible. Thus, whether or not legal restrictions on postal junk mail are justified, there should be such restrictions on sending junk e-mail.

Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning above?
A. Legal restrictions should be placed on a form of communication only if one can negatively affect other people by using it. 
B. Legal restrictions should be placed on any form of communication that might interfere with a recipient's ability to receive communication. 
C. If legal restrictions on postal junk mail are justified, then legal restrictions should be placed on all forms of communication. 
D. Legal restrictions can be placed on a form of communication even if it does not have the potential to produce serious problems for the whole society. 
E. Legal restrictions should be placed on a form of communication only if doing so would make that form of communication more efficient.",B
"Psychologist: Most social situations can be interpreted in a wide variety of ways, both positive and negative. Yet those who cannot formulate several possible interpretations of a situation are more likely to interpret the situation negatively and to feel sad about it. Hence, one of the most effective ways to avoid sadness is to learn to recognize and tolerate ambiguity. 
Which one of the following is an assumption the psychotherapist's argument requires?
A) Those who can formulate several possible interpretations of a situation are likely to see that situation as purely positive.
B) One of the most effective ways to avoid feeling sad about a situation is to understand that several interpretations of any situation are possible.
C) Those who have learned to recognize and tolerate ambiguity are more likely to be able to formulate several possible interpretations of a social situation.
D) To avoid feeling sad about a situation, it is necessary to recognize that there are several possible interpretations of that situation.
E) For a typical social situation, anyone who formulates only negative interpretations of that situation is likely to feel sad as a result.",C
"Farmer: According to United Nations estimates, almost 250 million hectares of new cropland will be needed over the next 30 years to feed the world's growing population. Yet in the countries where population growth is most rapid, there are only about 50 million hectares of undeveloped land that could be turned to conventional agricultural use. There are, however, new agricultural techniques that make it possible to grow crops on a great deal of land unsuitable for conventional agriculture, so farmers clearly need to begin using these techniques if the increasing population is to be fed. 
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the farmer's argument?
A) The undeveloped land that could be used for conventional agriculture in the countries whose populations are growing most rapidly makes up the great majority of such land available worldwide.
B) In the countries whose populations are growing most rapidly, much of the land that is unsuitable for conventional agriculture is developed.
C) If farmers begin growing crops on all of the land unsuitable for conventional agriculture, enough food could be produced to feed the world's population over the next 30 years.
D) The new agricultural techniques that make it possible to grow crops on land that is unsuitable for conventional agriculture also make it possible for crops to be grown on almost any land that is suitable for conventional agriculture.
E) Over the next 30 years, the countries whose populations are growing most rapidly are likely to discover new techniques for feeding their growing populations.",A
"People have informal obligations both to other people and to institutions. An obligation to the government is different from any of these. When you have an obligation to the government, that obligation is encoded in law. If you break a law, representatives of the government can try to force you to do what the law demands. The legal right to initiate the use of force makes the government different from all other institutions. 
Which one of the following most accurately expresses the conclusion of the argument as a whole?
A) An obligation to the government is different from informal obligations to people and institutions.
B) When you have an obligation to the government, that obligation is encoded in law.
C) The legal right to initiate the use of force makes the government different from all other institutions.

"The incidence of collisions with large pieces of debris left in orbit from previous space missions is greatest for spacecraft such as communications satellites that orbit highest above the Earth. The reason is that there are more large pieces of debris there than closer to the Earth. The risk of serious damage by debris, however, is greater for spacecraft in low orbits than for spacecraft in high orbits, because ... 
Which one of the following, if true, provides the best explanation to complete the passage?
A) High-speed collisions with small pieces of debris, which can cause irreparable ruptures in spacecraft surfaces, are more frequent for spacecraft in lower orbits than for spacecraft in higher orbits.
B) Some spacecraft launched into orbit complete their missions and return to Earth without leaving any debris in either high or low orbits.
C) Telescopes and radar can detect the path of debris with better accuracy for debris orbiting closer to the Earth than for debris in higher orbits.
D) Communications satellites cannot be maneuvered around large pieces of debris, but piloted spacecraft such as space shuttles, which orbit closer to the Earth, can avoid such hazards.
E) Spacecraft orbiting the Earth are more likely to collide with orbiting debris than with objects such as meteoroids, which pass by the Earth relatively quickly.",A
"Before the advent of modern statehood and mass media, languages with common roots blended into one another much more than they do today. There was, for example, a smoothly graded continuum of dialects from the ""French"" spoken in Paris to the ""Italian"" spoken in Rome. Today, clear political boundaries and mass media have resulted in distinct, homogeneous languages. In biology, we observe a similar phenomenon: Where populations are spread evenly over a large area, some species blend into one another. Thus, where populations have become geographically isolated from one another, we should expect to find ... 
Which one of the following most logically completes the argument?
A) Clearly distinct species.
B) Smooth continuums between species.
C) Minor physical differences from organism to organism.
D) A lack of homogeneity within populations.
E) Species that have no relationship to one another.",A
"Principle: If a significant hardship is caused by obeying a subpoena—a court order to present evidence—the court should nullify the subpoena unless the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued convinces the court that evidence relevant to its case could be acquired only through that subpoena. 
Application: When a professional writer was ordered by subpoena to release an unpublished article to the court, the court nullified the subpoena because it was convinced that the article would be published before the trial date, thereby becoming available to everyone. 
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the above application of the principle?
A) The party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued was a source of some of the information found in the unpublished article.
B) The writer has no information relevant to the case other than what is contained in the article.
C) The article would no longer be publishable if it were revealed to the court.

"Many specialists in education believe that, in general, students do better on papers if they write the paper in the room in which they read their research material, because they make unconscious associations between the material read and certain features of the room. Despite this, these specialists advise that students not write the paper in the same room in which they did the research.
Which one of the following, if true, does most to justify the apparently paradoxical view described above?
A) Students are more likely to retain what they have learned in writing a paper if they do not write it in the same room in which their research was done. 
B) Despite the fact that there is considerable evidence supporting the specialists' claims concerning paper writing, the evidence is not entirely conclusive. 
C) Students who write a paper in a room similar to the room in which they read their research material do just as well on the paper as students who do research and write in the same room. 
D) Students do better on papers if they did at least part of their research in the room in which they write the paper. 
E) Students do equally well on revising a paper whether or not they revise it in the same room in which they did their research.",A
"In a typical university class in calculus, only 20 percent of the students regularly come to sessions devoted to practicing techniques for solving standard calculus problems. On average, those 20 percent get much better grades in the course than do their classmates who skip these sessions. It is clear, therefore, that the practice sessions help students attending them learn how to solve calculus problems more effectively.
Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?
A) Some students who attend the practice sessions are no faster at solving calculus problems than are their classmates who skip the sessions. 
B) Students who attend the practice sessions are more likely to go on to take further mathematics courses than are their classmates who skip the sessions. 
C) Students who attend the practice sessions are likely to want to receive high grades in their university calculus class.

"Sociologist: A prominent critic argues that because our culture consigns people of advanced age to social invisibility and fails to provide adequate outlets for their abilities, it is therefore obsessed with youth. But though it is true that our culture is obsessed with youth, the critic's argument ignores the fact that our culture treats very young people no better than it treats very old people. So there is no connection between society's obsession with youth and the social ills the critic cites.
Which one of the following most accurately describes the sociologist's argument?
A) It rejects the critic's conclusion on the grounds that it is not supported by the premises of the critic's argument. 
B) It accepts the critic's conclusion, but rejects the reasoning the critic has given to support that conclusion. 
C) It neither accepts nor rejects the critic's conclusion, but expresses doubt as to whether it is supported by the evidence the critic cites.

The critic's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
A) Shakespeare held beliefs about human nature that were different from those of Socrates. 
B) Those Shakespearean villains who believe in the goodness of what they do are plausible for readers who accept the teachings of Socrates. 
C) A person's belief in the moral goodness of his or her own actions is insufficient to make those actions morally good.

"A government should not try to suppress the ideas contained in a book by banning it, since reports of this censorship will only heighten the public's curiosity about the book, which in turn will cause the book to have a greater, albeit illegal, circulation than it would otherwise have had.
Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above?
A) Farmers should not try to increase yields through the use of pesticides since this will cause harmful chemicals to be found on produce, which will in turn increase the rate of illness among consumers. 
B) A government should not try to reduce traffic jams by requiring commuters to carpool, since such requirements are often perceived as unjust and thus ignored, with the result that congestion is as bad as before. 
C) One should not try to learn to cook by watching cooking shows on television or by reading cookbooks, since one can learn how to cook only by learning the appropriate textures, odors, and tastes of foods, and these cannot be communicated through books or television. 
D) Unpopular authors should not try to sell more books by changing styles to fit public taste, since public taste changes so quickly, and no one can predict what will be popular at the exact moment a book is published. 
E) One should not try to solve a rodent problem through the use of pesticides, because chronic use of pesticides will only result in rodents with resistance to those pesticides, and so one will end up with more rodents than before.",E
"Scientific researchers only a few decades ago benefited more from results in related fields than do today's researchers, because they were able to stay abreast of important developments in several disciplines. Today the extraordinary volume of relevant information from outside disciplines renders sifting through it to achieve a similar familiarity with several disciplines nearly impossible, even though there are many problems that can be solved only by using just such an interdisciplinary perspective.
The situation described above most closely conforms to which one of the following generalizations?
A) An increase in the amount of information relevant to a research problem can interfere with a researcher's ability to solve that problem. 
B) The greater the number of colleagues a researcher has, the more he or she needs to solicit help from them in determining which information from outside disciplines is relevant. 
C) It is not always best for a researcher to gather as much relevant information as possible when trying to solve a specific problem. 
D) The more research conducted in a discipline, the more important it becomes for researchers in that discipline to share that information with researchers in other disciplines.

However, it appears that the painted crosswalks do not have their intended effect, since, as researchers have found, pedestrians crossing at intersections where crosswalks are painted are typically in greater danger from traffic than are pedestrians crossing at other intersections.
Which one of the following is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument overlooks the possibility that:
A) the city paints crosswalks only at intersections that are the most dangerous.
B) intersections where crosswalks are painted are typically crossed by pedestrians just as frequently as other intersections are.
C) pedestrians are also in danger at intersections that do not have painted crosswalks.

Which one of the following most accurately expresses the conclusion drawn in the argument?
A) Skills are learned more easily with the help of interactive software than with methods that are more conventional.
B) Practice is an effective means of learning skills only if learners receive feedback on their practice.
C) It is not surprising that conventional methods are less effective than interactive software at teaching skills.

The reasoning above is flawed in that it:
A) presumes, without providing justification, that higher property values would be advantageous.
B) fails to consider the possibility that the new mall proposal may not be approved.
C) takes for granted that if two things are correlated, one must be the cause of the other.

"In most seas, shipworms are by far the most common cause of decay in sunken wooden ships. Shipworms cannot survive in water below a certain salinity level, however. Since the salinity level of the Baltic Sea is too low for shipworms, sunken wooden ships in the Baltic Sea should typically be in better condition than similarly aged sunken wooden ships in most other seas, all else being equal.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A) No natural predators of shipworms exist in most seas.
B) The Baltic Sea has a salinity level lower than that of any other sea.
C) High salinity levels do not drastically retard the decaying effects that water has on sunken wooden ships.

"Researcher: The likely cause of recent whale beachings in the North Atlantic is sonar. All of the whale beachings occurred near massive sonar operations, and all of the beached whales were healthy except for having inner ear damage, which can be caused by heavy exposure to sonar. Whales with inner ear damage become disoriented, and disoriented whales will mistakenly swim too close to shore, beaching themselves.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
A) There are cases in which whales that have never been exposed to intense sonar have beached themselves.
B) The whales involved in the recent beachings were all members of species that feed on squid, which sometimes swim close to shore.

The conclusion of the argument above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
A) Any animal that usually engages in behavior that is not purely instinctive is extremely intelligent. 
B) Animals most of whose behavior is purely instinctive cannot be intelligent. 
C) The behavior patterns of insects are among the most complex and apparently purposeful behavior patterns of any animals on Earth.

"Rose: The book is either by Deerson or else by Jones; I'm not sure which. However, Deerson's books are generally published by Quince Press, as are Jones's. Therefore, the book is probably published by Quince.
The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in Rose's argument?
A) That tree is either a beech or else an elm, and Mercedes can identify most trees, so she will probably be able to tell which it is. 
B) The culprits escaped either by car or else on foot, but in either case they must have opened Isidore's creaking gate. Therefore Isidore probably heard them. 
C) Judging by what he said in the interview, George is either a liar or incredibly naive. Both these attributes are unsuitable in a customs inspector. Therefore George should not be hired as a customs inspector. 
D) Margarethe the Second was born either in Luppingshavn or else in Kindelberg. Most of the people in each city then were of Mondarian descent, so Margarethe probably had Mondarian ancestors.

However, for an entire week—the final week of the theater's operation, after the announcement of the impending closure—the place was sold out every night and made a healthy profit. Therefore, the owners' claim was clearly false.
Which one of the following contains an error of reasoning most similar to that made in the argument above?
A) On the many occasions similar to the present when the library's budget was cut, staff layoffs resulted, so even though the administration denies it, the proposed budget cuts are bound to mean staff layoffs. 
B) The proposed cuts in library funding would require reducing the hours of the periodicals room. But that is a room in which many students like to study, so the proposed cuts are bound to stir up considerable opposition. 
C) All of the students who came to the meeting about proposed cuts in library funding were strongly opposed to the cuts, so all of the students currently enrolled must be strongly opposed. 
D) The overall reduction in the university's budget is 10 percent. The library's budget is being cut by 10 percent. Therefore the library's budget cut is fair. 
E) The administration claims that the library's funding must be cut because of last year's poor library fund drive. However, the athletic department's budget is being increased. Therefore, the administration's claim must be false.",C

"Mayor Tyler: In 1982 the courthouse that Roseville still needs would have cost $26 million. Now in 1992 the same building is costing the city close to $30 million to build. If the courthouse had been built in 1982 when I first showed how the building would relieve the overcrowding we were experiencing, Roseville would have saved at least $4 million by now. 
Councillor Simón: Your own financial reports inform us that $26 million in 1982 dollars is equivalent to $37 million in 1992 dollars. Adding that difference to the money Roseville has saved by not having to maintain an underutilized courthouse for ten years, we can only view the delay as a financial boon for Roseville.

"Sometimes individuals must choose between two courses of action: one that most benefits the community and another that most benefits the person making the decision. Faced with such a choice, individuals tend to choose the course of action most beneficial to themselves. It is therefore a principle of good government to adjust the incentives and disincentives for private individuals so that such choices rarely arise, ensuring as far as possible that what is the best choice for individuals is the best choice for the community.

Which one of the following best illustrates an application of the cited principle of good government?
A) In order to escape charges of favoritism, the city government awards the contract for a new courthouse to a different developer from the one who completed the new city hall, even though the contract bids from both developers were the same. 
B) In order to satisfy a powerful law-and-order group, the legislature rejects a new bill protecting suspects' rights, despite the bill's popularity among voters in general. 
C) In order to placate laid-off government workers who have demanded help in acquiring skills necessary for private industry jobs, the government diverts funds from existing social programs to a new job-training program.

"Competitive figure skaters are judged by panels of up to nine judges, who use a numerical scale with the highest mark being 6. To arrive at a total score, all judges' marks are summed. Competitive divers are judged by panels of five or seven judges using a scale with 10 as the highest mark. Before all judges' marks are summed to a final score, however, the highest and lowest marks are discarded in order to eliminate the possibility of bias either in favor of or against a particular diver. Competitive figure skating should adopt the approach taken in diving because it is a fairer system.
Which one of the following can be inferred from the passage above? 
A. There is wider disagreement among figure skating judges than among diving judges. 
B. Currently, there is a greater possibility of bias in the scoring process for competitive figure skating than in that for diving. 
C. It is more likely that a diver will receive a biased total score than that a skater will. 
D. It is fairer to judge a competitor on a 10-point scale than a 6-point scale.

"Dead, rotting logs on the forest floor provide the habitat for a small mammal, the red-backed vole, which subsists almost entirely on the portion of certain specialized fungi which grows aboveground. The fungi-spores are deposited on the forest floor by the voles. Some of the fungi that develop from these spores form underground sheaths around the fine roots of growing trees, and assist the trees by processing and sharing nutrients and producing an antibiotic which protects the trees from disease.

The information above provides the most support for which one of the following conclusions? 
A. The presence of rotting logs on a forest floor can have beneficial effects on the trees around them. 
B. The red-backed vole is usually able to derive nutrients from the spores of the fungi it eats. 
C. Young, growing trees could not survive without the voles to distribute the spores of certain fungi. 
D. The spores of certain fungi cannot remain viable above the ground but must be deposited near the roots of trees. 
E. Dead and decaying trees are the ideal environment for the growth of certain fungi.",A
"McBride: The proposed new fuel-efficiency standards, if implemented, will discourage the manufacture of full-size cars. This prospect is troubling because when a subcompact and a full-size car collide, the people in the subcompact are more likely to be seriously injured than if theirs had also been a full-size car. The new fuel-efficiency standards should therefore be opposed.
Leggett: But whenever any two cars collide, it is more likely that someone will be seriously injured if one of the cars is a full-size car than if neither car is full-size. So the new fuel-efficiency standards should be supported precisely because they discourage the manufacture of full-size cars.

Which one of the following argumentative strategies does Leggett use in attempting to refute McBride's position? 
A. Demonstrating that McBride's claims are contradictory. 
B. Challenging the unstated assumption that all cars are either full-size or subcompact. 
C. Shifting the perspective from which the issue of automobile safety is considered. 
D. Raising doubts about the accuracy of a generalization made by McBride. 
E. Demonstrating that it is impossible to follow the course of action advocated by McBride.",C
"Environmentalists: It takes less energy to make molten glass from recycled glass than from raw materials. Once the recycled glass or raw materials have been turned into molten glass, making bottles from recycled glass follows the same process as making bottles from raw materials. Obviously, soft drink bottlers who make a large percentage of their bottles from recycled glass have significant energy savings. Therefore, by using recycled glass instead of glass made from raw materials, bottlers can lower their costs and benefit the environment at the same time.

Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies? 
A. The process of making bottles from plastic that has been recycled is not significantly more energy-efficient than is the process of making bottles from glass that has been recycled. 
B. The amount of glass that is currently recycled each year is enough to supply the major soft drink bottlers with materials for a large percentage of the glass bottles they make that year. 
C. Most consumers are not able to distinguish bottles made from recycled glass from glass bottles made from raw materials. 
D. Purchasing and transport costs are not so much greater for recycled glass than for raw materials that they outweigh the savings in energy costs resulting from the use of recycled glass. 
E. The process of making molten glass from recycled glass requires fewer steps than does the process of making molten glass from raw materials.",D
"Although many seventeenth-century broadsides, popular ballads printed on a single sheet of paper and widely sold by street peddlers, were moralizing in nature, this is not evidence that most seventeenth-century people were serious about moral values. While over half of surviving broadsides contain moralizing statements, and it is known that many people purchased such compositions, it is not known why they did so, nor is it known how their own beliefs related to what they read.

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
A. Like other forms of cheap seventeenth-century popular literature, surviving broadsides seem mostly to have been of rather low literary quality and to have been written by hack writers. 
B. In many moralizing ballads, the moral content was confined to a single stanza expressing a pious sentiment tacked onto a sensationalized account of crime and adultery. 
C. Some seventeenth-century ballad sellers also sold sermons printed in pamphlet form. 
D. The clergy occasionally stuck broadsides warning about the danger of strong drink on the doors of seventeenth-century alehouses. 
E. Well-educated people of the seventeenth century held broadsides in contempt and considered peddlers to be disreputable vagrants.",B
"Researcher: Electronic pingers emit a sound that repels dolphins. Attaching such pingers to fishing nets, thus ensuring that dolphins do not become entangled in the nets, will help solve the conflict between the safety of dolphins and the needs of commercial fishing operations.
Which one of the following is an assumption that is required by the researcher's argument?
A: The pingers do not repel the fish that commercial fishing operations are trying to catch.
B: Commercial fishing is most common in areas of the sea where the dolphin population is large.
C: The pingers have no adverse effects on other mammals in the vicinity of the nets.
D: Dolphins are the only animals inadvertently caught in the nets of commercial fishing operations.
E: Electronic pingers are the most effective way to warn dolphins of the presence of nets.",A
"In jurisdictions where use of headlights is optional when visibility is good, drivers who use headlights at all times are less likely to be involved in a collision than are drivers who use headlights only when visibility is poor. Yet Highway Safety Department records show that making use of headlights mandatory at all times does nothing to reduce the overall number of collisions.

Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above?
A: In jurisdictions where use of headlights is optional when visibility is good, one driver in four uses headlights for daytime driving in good weather.
B: A law making use of headlights mandatory at all times is not especially difficult to enforce.
C: Only very careful drivers use headlights when their use is not legally required.
D: There are some jurisdictions in which it is illegal to use headlights when visibility is good.
E: The jurisdictions where use of headlights is mandatory at all times are those where daytime visibility is frequently poor.",C
"The Venetian Renaissance painter Vittore Carpaccio used sumptuous reds in most of his paintings. Since the recently discovered Venetian Renaissance painting Erato contains notable sumptuous reds, it is probably by Carpaccio.

Which one of the following contains a pattern of flawed reasoning most similar to that in the argument above?
A: Most Renaissance painters worked in a single medium, either tempera or oil. Since the Renaissance painting Calypso's Bower is in oil, its painter probably always used oil.
B: In Italian Renaissance painting, the single most common subject was the Virgin and Child, so the single most common subject in Western art probably is also the Virgin and Child.
C: Works of art in the Renaissance were mostly commissioned by patrons, so the Renaissance work The Dances of Terpsichore was probably commissioned by a patron.
D: The anonymous painting St. Sebastian is probably an early Florentine painting since it is in tempera, and most early Florentine paintings were in tempera.
E: Since late-Renaissance paintings were mostly in oil, the Venetian late-Renaissance painter Arnoldi, whose works are now lost, probably painted in oil.",D
"Zebra mussels, a nuisance when they clog the intake pipes of nuclear power plants and water plants along the Great Lakes, have some redeeming qualities. Since the mussels feed voraciously on algae that they filter from the water that passes by them, bags of zebra mussels suspended in the discharge streams of chemical plants significantly improve water quality, even removing some hazardous wastes.

Which one of the following is most strongly supported on the basis of the statements above?
A: Zebra mussels arrived in the Great Lakes on transatlantic freighters and, since they have no natural enemies there, are rapidly displacing the native species of clams.
B: If the mussels spread to areas of the Mississippi River where native clams provide the basis for a cultured-pearl industry, that industry will collapse, since the mussels are unsuitable for such use and would displace the clams.
C: There is no mechanical means available for clearing intake pipes by scraping the mussels from them.
D: The algae on which the mussels feed would, if not consumed by the mussels, themselves clog the intake pipes of nuclear power plants and water plants.
E: Any hazardous waste the mussels remove from chemical-plant discharge will remain in the mussels, if they do not transform it, and they then must be regarded as hazardous waste.",E
"The coming economic recovery will surely be strong. Most of the economists in investment companies now agree that this is so, though the leading academic economists still think otherwise. Since the investment companies' economists are risking their jobs when they make forecasts, whereas academic economists have lifelong tenure, it generally makes sense to take the investment companies' economists more seriously.

The main conclusion of the argument is supported only
A: by comparing the number of experts who agree with the conclusion with the number who disagree with the conclusion
B: through an assessment of the likely risks and consequences of believing one or another strand of expert opinion
C: through projection from the economic prospects for investment companies to the economic prospects for the economy as a whole
D: through an assessment of the relative reliability of the experts who agree with the conclusion as compared with that of those who disagree
E: by attacking the character of those who disagree with the conclusion",D
"John wants to win the annual Mayfield raffle next year because he needs the Mayfield raffle's prize. If he enters more than one raffle next year, the likelihood of his winning one of them would be greater than if he entered only a single raffle. Hence, to have this greater likelihood of winning the Mayfield raffle prize, John should enter several other raffles next year.

The argument exhibits which one of the following flaws in reasoning?
A: presupposing that a person's strong desire for a certain outcome increases the likelihood that the actual outcome will be as desired
B: mistaking for the activity itself the goal for which one pursues that activity
C: assuming without warrant that a person will be successful if the person engages only in those activities that are likely to be successful
D: assuming that an event, if it is highly improbable, cannot possibly occur
E: confusing the likelihood that at least one event in a set of events will occur with the likelihood that a designated event in that set will occur",E
"Treasure hunter: In general, archaeological artifacts found on public property cannot legally be privately owned. But according to centuries-old maritime law, people who risk their lives attempting to rescue a ship in peril are permitted to keep whatever cargo they can salvage. Under this rule, treasure hunters clearly are entitled to keep the cargo from ancient shipwrecks that they risk their lives to save from oblivion in public waters.
Archaeologist: Not so. These shipwrecks have stabilized over the centuries they have lain underwater. The only danger they are in is from greedy treasure hunters who destroy archaeological evidence in their hurry to loot salable artifacts.

On the evidence of their statements, it can be concluded that the treasure hunter and the archaeologist disagree on which one of the following? 
A) what constitutes an archaeological artifact
B) in what sense, if any, an ancient shipwreck can be said to be in peril
C) whether treasure hunters risk their lives when they retrieve artifacts from ancient shipwrecks
D) whether maritime law can ever be applied to a ship that has already sunk
E) whether antique shipwrecks in public waters can properly be said to be on public property",B
"Concerns for the environment have led chemists to develop plastics that are degradable. All degradable plastics, which are potentially useful packaging materials, need just the right conditions to break down. Some need only exposure to sunlight, some need to be buried in soil and some need to be submerged in water. It should be cautioned that some degradable plastics leave residues of unknown toxicity.

If all of the statements in the passage are true, which one of the following must also be true?
A) Some materials that are potentially useful for packaging leave residues of unknown toxicity.
B) Some degradable plastics need both sunlight and submersion in order to break down.
C) Some materials that need sunlight in order to break down are not potentially useful packaging materials.
D) Some materials that leave residues of unknown toxicity are not degradable plastics.
E) Some materials that need to be buried in soil to break down leave residues of unknown toxicity.",A
"Automobile manufacturers who began two decades ago to design passenger vehicles that were more fuel-efficient faced a dilemma in the fact that the lighter, more efficient vehicles were less safe on high-speed highways. However, the manufacturers avoided this dilemma by producing two types of passenger vehicles: a lighter vehicle for medium-speed, local transportation, and a heavier, safer vehicle for long-distance travel. Since most automobile traffic is local, a net savings in fuel use was achieved with no loss in safety.
Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
A) Most households whose members do any long-distance driving own at least two passenger vehicles.
B) There are more cars using high-speed highways today than there were two decades ago.
C) Even large automobiles are lighter today than similar-sized vehicles were two decades ago.
D) Most high-speed highways are used by both commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles.
E) Some automobile manufacturers designed prototypes for fuel-efficient passenger vehicles more than two decades ago.",A
"Gerrit: While browsing in a record store I noticed that one copy of a recording I wanted had mistakenly been priced at a quarter of the list price. When I finally reached the cashier I was told that the price had been mismarked and I would have to pay the full list price. Since I had wasted an hour standing in line, the retailer was morally obligated to sell me the recording at the lower price.
Saskia: I disagree. You knew that a mistake had been made, and you were simply trying to take advantage of that mistake.

Which one of the following principles, if established, would most help to justify Saskia's position?
A) The price displayed on an item in a retail store morally constitutes an irrevocable offer to sell the item at that price.
B) Customers of retail stores are morally entitled to profit from any mistakes that the retailers make in marking prices.
C) Retailers are morally entitled to update marked prices periodically in order to reflect changes in manufacturers' suggested prices.
D) Retailers are morally obligated to meet expectations about prices that they have intentionally encouraged their customers to hold.
E) Retailers are morally obligated to sell an item to a customer at a mismarked price only if that customer was genuinely misled about the intended price by the mismarking.",E
"In casual conversation, people experience little psychological discomfort in admitting that they have some particular character flaw, but only if they consider trivial the flaw to which they admit. Therefore, if in a casual conversation an individual readily admits that he or she has some particular character flaw, the individual must not consider that flaw to be serious.

Which one of the following is an assumption necessary to the argument? 
A) Most character flaws are considered trivial by those who have them.
B) People admit to having only those character flaws that most other people consider trivial.
C) In casual conversation, people admit to having character flaws only when they must.
D) In casual conversation, people readily admit to having a character flaw only when that admission causes them little psychological discomfort.
E) In casual conversation, people do not speak of things that would give others an unfavorable impression of their character.",D
"Professor Edwards must have revealed information that was embarrassing to the university. After all, to have been publicly censured by the head of the university, as Edwards was, a professor must either have revealed information that embarrassed the university or have been guilty of gross professional negligence, and Edwards' professional behavior is impeccable.
Which one of the following arguments exhibits a pattern of reasoning most similar to that in the argument above?
A) According to company policy, employees who are either frequently absent without notice or who are habitually late receive an official warning. Since Ms. Jensen has never received such a warning, rumors that she is habitually late must be false.
B) Any employee of Wilkins, Waddell, and Sloan who discusses a client with a member of the press will be either fired or demoted. But since Wilkins employees never discuss their clients at all, no Wilkins employee will ever be demoted.
C) Anyone promoted to supervisor must either have worked on the shop floor for three years or have an influential sponsor. Daniels, therefore, clearly has an influential sponsor, since he was promoted to supervisor after only one year on the shop floor.
D) To earn a merit salary increase, an employee of TGX must either bring in new clients or develop innovative products. No innovative products were developed at TGX this year, however, so TGX employees must have brought in many new clients.
E) Anyone who is either awarded a letter of commendation or who receives a bonus must be recommended by a company officer. Simon has been recommended by a company officer and will receive a bonus, so he must not have been awarded a letter of commendation.",C
