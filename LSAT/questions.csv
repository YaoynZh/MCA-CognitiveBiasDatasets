"Simone: Technology is now available that, through precise alteration of human genetic material, can prevent some of the more severe complications caused by genetic diseases. Thus, a role for medical science is to use this technology to stop these diseases before they lead to serious problems. We should not hinder medical progress out of fear of possible abuses of it.
Juana: You are trading one set of problems for a considerably more dangerous set. If you allow the use of technology to tamper with human genetic material, only imagination sets limits to the tragedies that could ensue.
Simone's and Juana's statements most strongly indicate that they disagree over whether
A) medical science should be involved in any genetic research on human beings
B) genetic diseases represent a serious health problem for human beings
C) altering human genes to prevent one set of genetic diseases will only lead to the creation of a new set of genetic diseases
D) altering human genetic material to stop disease will have ill effects
E) the risks involved in stopping disease by altering human genetic material are worth taking",E
"Book reviewer: The author's aim is to show that Milio Vitolais one of the most underrated artists of the last century. But whereas he cites a wealth of negative assessments by other art historians, he does little to show that these assessments are wrong. And it must be confessed that the book's reproductions of Vitola's works reveal no artistic skill whatsoever. Thus, the author is...
Which one of the following most logically completes the book reviewer's final sentence?
A) not successful in fulfilling his intentions

"Hasina: Our province has enacted new workplace standards to protect employees from repetitive stress injuries. The new law requires businesses employing at least nine workers to create safer working conditions on the job and permits the workers to demand specific solutions for their problems. This law should be widely enforced. If it is, it will dramatically reduce the number of repetitive stress injuries in our province.
Which one of the following, if true, most supports the claim made in the last sentence of Hasina's argument?
A) Most people in the province who experience repetitive stress injuries work for businesses that have at least nine employees.
B) Recently, public awareness of repetitive stress injuries has greatly increased, and consequently the incidence of repetitive stress injury is already going down.
C) Measures are now being taken that will guarantee the wide dissemination of information about this law, as well as its consistent enforcement.
D) Some of the largest businesses in the province have already voluntarily instituted standards similar to those of the new law.
E) The new law also contains measures that will increase the likelihood that people suffering from repetitive stress injuries will report those injuries to their employers and public health officials.",A
"Patents are issued only for inventions that are both novel and useful. Because of rapid advances in the field of computer science, an extremely high number of patents issued last year were issued for computer algorithms. However, a new law prohibits the issue of patents for computer algorithms, and thus the number of patents issued this year will be significantly less than it would have been otherwise.

Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A) Were it not for the new law, some computer algorithms would receive patents this year.
B) Last year, more than half of the patents issued were for computer algorithms.
C) The field of computer science is responsible for the majority of recent inventions.
D) Of the computer algorithms that were submitted for patents in the past several years, most were eventually issued patents.
E) More patents for novel and useful inventions were issued last year than will be issued this year.",A
"All load-bearing supports are essential structural elements. Some walls are not essential structural elements. Thus, some walls are not load-bearing supports.

Which one of the following is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above?
A) All items purchased at this store are returnable. Some of Pat's items are not returnable. Hence some of Pat's items were not purchased at this store.
B) All sandstone rocks are sedimentary rocks. All sedimentary rocks are formed by deposition of particles. So all sandstone rocks are formed by deposition of particles.
C) All officers of this group are licensed and bonded. Some people who are licensed and bonded are not trustworthy. Therefore, some officers of this group are not trustworthy.
D) All slipcovers are protective. Some ornamental lace items laid on furniture are not slipcovers. Thus, some ornamental lace items laid on furniture are not protective.
E) All plays are entertainment. Some entertainment is not worthy of serious attention. It follows that some plays are not worthy of serious attention.",A
"Museum director: Our city's economy is heavily dependent on tourism. Most of the tourists visiting our city go to the city art museum at some time during their stay. Therefore, to protect the city's economy, the art museum must be maintained as an appealing tourist attraction.

The museum director's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
A) It overlooks the possibility that tourists who visit the art museum also contribute to the city's economy in other ways.
B) It fails to adequately address the possibility that almost all the tourists who go to the art museum would visit the city even if the art museum were not an appealing tourist attraction.
C) It fails to adequately address the possibility that the city's economy may not be protected even if the art museum is maintained as an appealing tourist attraction.
D) It takes for granted that, apart from the art museum, there is no other tourist attraction in the city to which most tourists go.
E) It overlooks the possibility that a tourist visiting the city who does not go to the art museum contributes just as much to the city's economy, on average, as one who does go to the art museum.",B
"In a study of several hundred scientists, researchers found that, on average, the more pieces of mediocre and flawed work a scientist in the study had produced, the more prominent and successful that scientist was.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy described above?
A) Most scientists produce a great deal of mediocre and flawed work in addition to any work they produce that contributes to their prominence and success.
B) The several hundred scientists in the study were not fully representative of scientists in general with respect to either the quality of their work or their prominence and success.
C) On average, the more pieces of important, high-quality work a scientist has produced, the more prominent and successful that scientist is.
D) The amount of mediocre and flawed work a scientist produces and the amount of work contributing to his or her prominence and success both tend to increase with the total amount of work he or she produces.
E) For a scientist to be prominent and successful, an unusually large proportion of that scientist's work must be superior to the quality of most scientistsâ€™ work.",D
"Carbon dioxide and water vapor in Earth's atmosphere warm Earth's surface by reducing the amount of heat that radiates back into outer space after reaching Earth's surface from the sun. Substantially higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and water vapor in the atmosphere would enhance this effect at least slightly. Such concentrations would also make the sky cloudier, which would significantly reduce the overall amount of heat reaching Earth's surface from the sun.
Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?
A) Substantially higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and water vapor in Earth's atmosphere would reduce the overall amount of heat that radiates back into outer space after reaching Earth's surface from the sun.

"Commuter: To induce commuters to take public buses and thereby relieve traffic congestion, Munville is considering raising the fees for downtown parking garages. Although raising parking fees would relieve traffic congestion, the city should not raise these fees. After all, commuting on the buses would be a major inconvenience for most commuters, since it is much slower and less reliable than driving.

Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the commuter's argument?
A) A city should not implement any policy without considering all probable consequences of the policy.
B) Given a choice between two measures that each achieve a desired goal, a city should implement the policy that inconveniences commuters less.
C) Commuters should be allowed to use the method of commuting that is fastest and most reliable for them.
D) A measure designed to relieve traffic congestion should be implemented only if doing so would not create inconvenience for commuters.
E) A city should not charge excessive fees for use of publicly owned facilities, even if doing so has socially desirable effects.",D
"Novelist: Rather than have characters trade unusually well-crafted lines or spout improbably polished speeches, my novels realistically portray human dialogue. Some literary critics dismiss the artistic achievement of these novels, but they are mistaken in doing so. Their basis for this view is their belief that it is easy to write natural-sounding dialogue. It is not. However, even if it were, that would not count in the least against the novels' artistic merit.

The claim that it is mistaken for literary critics to dismiss the artistic achievement of the novels plays which one of the following roles in the novelist's argument?
A) It is a tangential comment that is not offered as part of the logical development of the argument.
B) It is one of two premises each of which purports to independently support the argument's conclusion.
C) It is the conclusion that the argument attempts to establish.
D) It is a premise that purports to be sufficient, in conjunction with another of the argument's premises, to establish the conclusion.
E) It is an intermediary conclusion, for which a premise is offered in support and that, in turn, purports to establish the overall conclusion.",C

Clearly, these new films result from a yearning for inventive filmmaking. Vernon: If you had seen any of these independent films, you would know that they are just as poor as studio productions. The trend is merely a search for inexpensive labor. Now that well-trained, experienced, unionized film crews are getting paid what they deserve, more filmmakers are using nonunionized crews. Far from being better than studio films, independent films add an incompetent crew to the usual list of incompetencies. 
Roberta's and Vernon's comments indicate that they disagree about 
A) the quality of studio filmmaking

Which one of the following is an assumption that the argument requires? 
A) Dairy farmers should try to maximize the percentage of total energy intake required by their cows for bodily maintenance. 
B) In the most productive cows, the amount of energy used for milk production is a fixed percentage of the amount of energy available for milk production. 
C) Dairy farmers should try to maximize the amount of energy used for bodily maintenance in their most productive cows.

A) most industries will not use more-advanced technology without being forced to do so 
B) a minimum-wage increase less effectively produces competition when the wage is raised quickly than when it is raised gradually

A) New economic opportunities will allow some European companies to produce goods that previously had to be imported.
B) Unified standards for European products will allow companies to streamline production of some goods, so the companies will be able to produce these goods more efficiently.
C) As trade barriers between European countries weaken, the volume of European goods traded within Europe will increase.

"Philosopher: Behaviorists hold that we can recognize the purpose of an action simply by observation, without any psychological consideration. They identify the purpose of behavior with the result it brings about. This is a mistake. Though the purpose of an action is the goal to which it is directed, this cannot be identified with the results it brings about. People often fail to achieve the results they expect or desire, or bring about unforeseen results.

Which one of the following sentences most accurately expresses the conclusion of the philosopher's argument?
A) People often do not bring about their intended goals.
B) Behavior cannot be explained in terms of conscious intent.
C) Goals and results are identical only for successful agents.
D) It is wrong to equate the intent of an action with its outcome.
E) Unintended results may confuse the observer of an action.",D
"Tasha: Novels rather than poetry make up most of the writing by nineteenth-century female writers because, lacking private writing rooms, most women wrote in noisy surroundings. Writing fiction requires less concentration than writing poetry.
Helen: You're right that most nineteenth-century women lacked private writing rooms, but lack of money was the reason they didn't write more poetry. Anyone who couldn't afford to have a private writing room also would have been unable to afford the formal literary education required for writing poetry.
Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken Helen's explanation?
A) Most nineteenth-century male writers did not have writing rooms of their own.
B) In the nineteenth century, a greater percentage of poets than novelists had private writing rooms.
C) Most nineteenth-century female poets were also novelists.
D) The institutions providing formal literary training in the nineteenth century excluded women.

People who suggest that you buy the cheapest house on the market and fix it up are not considering that you do not have the time or expertise to repair a run-down house, nor are they considering the costs of doing such work.

The reasoning of the real estate agent's argument is flawed because this argument
A) presumes, without providing justification, that no one buying a home has the time or skill to repair a run-down house
B) illicitly appeals to the fears or insecurities of the client
C) illicitly employs two different senses of the word ""cheapest""
D) considers only one of several possible alternatives to the option it attempts to support
E) fails to consider that the cost of the least expensive house combined with the expenses arising from its repair may be no more than the cost of the most expensive house",D
"The continued survival of endangered animal species requires the preservation of their threatened habitats, and this can be accomplished only through the development of economic benefits tied to the preservation of these habitats. Therefore, the development of new pharmaceutical drugs that come from products found in the world's rain forests can be an enormous aid to the survival of many endangered animal species.

Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
A) Most of the rain forest products from which pharmaceutical drugs are developed can be found in places other than rain forests.
B) Some habitats of endangered animals are not located in rain forests.
C) Once a threatened habitat is preserved, all of the species that reside in it will survive.

E) At least some companies that produce pharmaceutical drugs are not willing to devote significant resources to the development of new drugs.",D
"Mathematician: Mathematics is often taught as if the object were simply to transmit a body of detailed information from teacher to student. But I hold that it is more important for teachers to impart an appreciation of the beauty and excitement of mathematics, since this approach has the following long-term effect: when students develop such an appreciation, they will be more motivated to learn the details on their own, which will lead them to take further mathematics courses and ultimately learn much more mathematics than they would if they lacked this appreciation.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the mathematician's reasoning?
A) The paramount goal in teaching mathematics should be to maximize the amount of mathematics students will ultimately learn.
B) It is no more important for students in a mathematics course to learn a body of detailed information than for them to become motivated to take further mathematics courses.
C) One goal in teaching mathematics should be to teach an appreciation of the beauty and excitement of mathematics.

"Professor: The economic measures proposed by our country's ruling party will result in windfall profits for a particular sector of our economy. But no economic measures should be approved unless they benefit our economy as a whole. So the proposed measures should not be approved.
The professor's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that:
A) the ruling party proposed the economic measures in question for reasons other than a concern for the overall well-being of the economy.
B) economic measures that result in windfall profits for one sector of the economy are also beneficial to the economy as a whole.

"Historian: Some historians of science consider there generally to be two kinds of science, normal science and revolutionary science. Practitioners of normal science accept all of their field's preconceptions, while practitioners of revolutionary science reject some of them. Because revolutionary science produces such dramatic changes, many historians focus on revolutionary science. But historians who focus exclusively on revolutionary science fail to gain a complete understanding of the revolutionary scientific movements they study.
Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the historian's claim that historians who focus exclusively on revolutionary science fail to gain a complete understanding of the revolutionary scientific movements they study?
A) Some prominent historians of science reject the distinction between normal and revolutionary science.
B) Historians who focus on revolutionary science underestimate the importance of the scientific advances made by normal science.
C) A very large proportion of scientific research falls into the category of normal science.

The argument above is most similar in its flawed reasoning to which one of the following arguments?
A) The Vicksville Museum is one of several businesses that make up the local tourist industry, and it provides a great deal of the tax revenue needed to operate the Vicksville School District. Therefore, the local tourist industry as a whole must provide all of the tax revenue needed to operate the School District.
B) A typical business in the local tourist industry provides a significant portion of the tax revenue needed to operate the Vicksville School District. Since the Vicksville Museum is a business in the local tourist industry, it must provide a significant portion of the tax revenue needed to operate the Vicksville School District.
C) The local tourist industry provides a great deal of the tax revenue needed to operate the Vicksville School District. The Vicksville Museum also provides a great deal of the tax revenue needed to operate the Vicksville School District. Thus, the Vicksville Museum must be one of several businesses that make up the local tourist industry.
D) The Vicksville Museum is one of several businesses that make up the local tourist industry. Many local industries provide a portion of the tax revenue needed to operate the Vicksville School District.

The stone tools discovered by the Shibato expedition display asymmetrical chipping, so they are more likely Neanderthal than Homo erectus.
The reasoning in McClosky's argument is flawed in that the argument fails to consider 
A) that stone tools may become asymmetrical chipped through repeated usage 
B) that many stone tools displaying asymmetrical chipping may be neither Neanderthal nor Homo erectus 
C) that a greater percentage of Homo erectus tools may have originally displayed asymmetrical chipping, but that this identifying feature may have worn away over time

Each of the following, if true, helps to explain the phenomenon described above except: 
A) People who would be bored by low-risk occupations would also be bored by low-risk leisure activities. 
B) A below-average ability to calculate risk makes people more likely to seek out not only high-risk leisure activities but also high-risk jobs. 
C) People who enjoy excitement are drawn both to high-risk jobs and to high-risk leisure activities.

"Cars with automatic transmissions are typically more expensive than cars with manual transmissions, and cars with air-conditioning tend to be more expensive than cars without air-conditioning. Thus, since Sasha's car has an automatic transmission, it probably has air-conditioning and must have been expensive.
The argument above is most similar in its flawed reasoning to which one of the following arguments? 
A) Inorganic chemicals are usually less complex than organic chemicals, and chemicals with low molecular weights are generally less complex than chemicals with high molecular weights. Thus, since the chemical being analyzed has a low molecular weight, it is probably inorganic and must not be complex. 
B) As a rule, hamsters are larger than gerbils and have larger litters than gerbils. Thus, since Bert's pet is a hamster, it is probably larger than a gerbil and must have been part of a large litter.

"Researchers trained an octopus to grab a red ball rather than a white one. Octopuses that watched the behavior of the trained one repeated that behavior when later placed in the same test situation, even though they were not similarly trained to do so. Nevertheless, critics contend that this does not show that octopuses can learn by watching.
Which one of the following, if true, most supports the critics' contention? 
A) No other researchers have observed untrained octopuses displaying a marked preference for seizing objects of a particular color over objects of other colors. 
B) The octopuses that watched the trained octopus originally came from a marine habitat in which some of their prey was reddish, but none was white.

The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
A) Satisfaction and pleasure are nothing more than physiological states of the organism experiencing them. 
B) Feelings accompanying the satisfaction of desires are genuinely valuable only if they are unusually intense. 
C) People are motivated to do whatever they do by the urge to satisfy one or another desire.

This suggests that most adults spend most of their leisure time at home.
The reasoning in the sociologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument 
A) fails to consider the possibility that the responses of many of the adults who participated in the survey did not fit into either of the two categories mentioned. 
B) draws a general conclusion about a population on the basis of a sample that was selected in a way likely to make it unrepresentative of that population. 
C) draws a conclusion about a large population on the basis of a sample that was too small to support any significant conclusions about the characteristics of such a population.

"Building bridges requires complex considerations. Water runs faster in those parts of a river where the banks are closest, causing greater stress on piers sunk in the river to support a bridge. Where the banks are farther apart, piers are subject to less stress, but more piers are required to span the greater distance, thus adding costs to the bridge. On the other hand, it is possible to reinforce piers to withstand greater stress, but only at greater expense. This enables engineers to ensure the safety of a bridge even when piers are subject to greater stress. While safety is paramount when engineers design a bridge, expense is a serious consideration. Therefore, when spanning a river, ...
Which one of the following statements best completes the passage above?

A) Judicial interpretations of a recently passed law are usually closer to the intentions of the legislators who crafted that law than are interpretations of older laws. This particular judicial interpretation is considered to be radical and the law was passed only recently, so the intentions of the legislators who passed the law must also have been considered radical.

"The asteroid Alpha-6, with a velocity of 85,000 kilometers per second, has for many years been the fastest known nonplanetary object in our galaxy. Recently, some astronomers claimed to have discovered a new asteroid moving at 93,000 kilometers per second. Due to an error in the computer program responsible for analyzing the astronomical data, however, the velocity of the new asteroid was greatly overestimated. So, despite these recent claims, Alpha-6 is the fastest nonplanetary object in our galaxy.
Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning above? 
A) It takes for granted that astronomers will never discover any nonplanetary objects in our galaxy moving faster than Alpha-6. 
B) It fails to provide conclusive scientific evidence for the claim that the astronomers' computer program was flawed.

Which one of the following, if true, most fully explains the decline and subsequent return of the attentiveness described above? 
A) Eight-month-old babies must be able to discern subtle differences between very similar speech sounds in order to begin to learn how to speak a language correctly, while older babies need to be more attentive to subtle differences in meaning.

A) Aurico's serves a spinach calzone made with low-fat mozzarella cheese in which only 32 percent of the calories come from fat. Since spinach has so many important vitamins, this calzone would make a healthful lunch. 
B) In a breakfast of strawberries, low-fat pastries, and cranberry juice, only about 5 percent of the calories come from fat. But this is not a healthful meal because it has too much sugar. 
C) The lunch special at the Coastal Cafe, an avocado sandwich and a bottle of spring water, is not a healthful lunch because 35 percent of the calories in this meal come from fat. 
D) In a breakfast of coffee, a banana, and Choco-Nuggets cereal with skim milk, less than 10 percent of the calories come from fat. So this is a healthful breakfast. 
E) In a breakfast of sausage and fried eggs, more than 30 percent of the calories come from fat. The same is true of a broccoli omelet, but the omelet is a more healthful breakfast because it includes a vegetable.",C
"Ancient civilizations often polluted their harbors with lead, which was used for activities like glassmaking and shipbuilding. In one case, the levels of lead found in an ancient sediment layer beneath a harbor were so high they could not have a natural cause. These high levels indicate that the harbor was used by a technologically advanced civilization at the time that the layer accumulated. 
The argument requires the assumption that: 
A) the ancient civilizations that were most advanced technologically left the most lead in their harbors 
B) only those ancient civilizations that were technologically advanced polluted their harbors with high levels of lead 
C) all technologically advanced ancient civilizations used lead for some purposes 
D) lead is the only pollutant that ancient civilizations released into harbors 
E) sediment layers beneath harbors have no naturally occurring lead at all",B
"Astrophysicist: Professor Bollinger maintains the theory that the origin of life on Earth was caused when a comet collided with our planet. In supporting this theory, Bollinger even quotes a recent paper in which I admitted that organic material is present in comets and that Earth did experience a collision with a comet prior to the emergence of life here. But the origin of life on our planet was not the single, sudden event the professor claims it was; hence Bollinger's theory is false.
Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning of the astrophysicist's argument?
(A) The argument simply denies the truth of the position it is trying to discredit without giving evidence against that position.
(B) The argument is inconsistent because it accepts the premises, but not the conclusion, of Professor Bollinger's argument.
(C) The argument attacks the character, rather than the argument, of Professor Bollinger.
(D) The argument fails to provide evidence that a comet collided with Earth prior to the emergence of life.
(E) The argument presumes that we can have knowledge of what occurred before the origin of life.",A
"Anderson: This advertisement for a computer threatens consumers with unemployment or premature aging unless the computer is used. The ad is insensitive to these consumers and should be banned. Parker: It is a common device for advertisers to suggest that people will suffer negative consequences unless they use the advertisers' products. It is ridiculous to ban such ads only because of possible negative reactions from people like you. You object to the ads only because of your own lack of computer skills.
Parker's response to Anderson is vulnerable to criticism on each of the following grounds except:
(A) Parker's response appeals to an established practice without providing the justification for the practice.
(B) Parker's response fails to show that the claim of insensitivity is unreasonable.
(C) Parker's response fails to consider whether the advertisement in question threatens consumers with anything less serious than unemployment or premature aging.
(D) Parker's response diverts attention from the issue at hand by attacking Anderson personally.
(E) Parker's response misrepresents the reason Anderson gives for supporting the ban.",C
"Leticia: People with an exceptional talent for teaching are morally obligated to spend their lives as teachers regardless of whether they would find that career fulfilling, simply because the need for outstanding teachers is so high. Eugene: Talent never carries with it any obligation to be used. It would be highly commendable for people with a talent for teaching to choose a career in teaching simply because society needs good teachers, but they would not be morally required to do so.
Leticia's and Eugene's statements provide the most support for holding that they would disagree over which one of the following?
(A) An exceptionally talented teacher who is offered a more lucrative job outside of teaching is morally bound to refuse the offer.
(B) It should be legally permissible for teachers who grow tired of their work to abandon it.
(C) Only students with an exceptional talent for teaching are morally required to become teachers.
(D) Some talented teachers who find that their job performance is impaired by stress would be better off if they gave up their positions.
(E) Exceptionally talented teachers can be even better at their work if they believe that they have a moral obligation to continue their careers.",A
"Cruise ship captain: Whatever the source of the Cyclospora that caused several people to become ill last Friday, it was not the initially suspected shipment of strawberries. Because Cyclospora spreads so rapidly, there would have been traces on all of the strawberries last Friday if the shipment had been contaminated then. But this Monday we examined several of the remaining strawberries and found no signs of Cyclospora.
The conclusion of the cruise ship captain's argument can be properly inferred if which one of the following is assumed?
A) If the strawberries had been contaminated with Cyclospora they would have caused some of the people who ate them to become ill.
B) If there were traces of Cyclospora on the remaining strawberries when they were examined this Monday, then the strawberries were already contaminated when people ate them last Friday.
C) If last Friday the shipment of strawberries had been contaminated, then traces of Cyclospora would have been detected when the remaining strawberries were examined this Monday.
D) If there were traces of Cyclospora on all of the strawberries last Friday, then there would have been traces of Cyclospora left on some of the strawberries this Monday.
E) The shipment of strawberries was not the only possible source of the Cyclospora that caused the illness.",C
"Economist: In order to shift from government-controlled to free-market economies, countries must privatize formerly state-owned companies and encourage the creation of new private companies. Established companies, because longevity has honed their efficiency, are preferable to new companies for the production of familiar goods, but new companies are preferable in all other areas. Thus the countries ought to encourage their citizens to create new companies to meet the challenge of producing mass quantities of the goods consumers desire.
Which one of the following is an assumption required by the economist's argument?
A) In countries shifting from government-controlled to free-market economies, there is consumer demand for goods unlike those previously produced in those countries.
B) Countries cannot successfully shift from government-controlled to free-market economies unless new companies are able to produce in sufficient quantities the goods consumers desire.
C) During times of large-scale economic transformation, governments face pressure to return to the practices of the old economy.
D) Companies that were once privately owned are less likely to resist privatization than are companies that were always owned by the state.
E) The longer a company has been in business, the more efficient it is.",A
"Ethicist: Recently, a student working on the research project led by Dr. Langley produced laboratory data that appeared promising but turned out to be fraudulent. Dr. Langley argues that the student should shoulder the blame, but Dr. Langley, who failed to conduct preventive checks, deserves chastisement. He should have had the experiments repeated before he allowed the student to disseminate the data.
Which one of the following principles most helps to justify the ethicist's reasoning?
(A) If a research leader suspects that a researcher's data from experiments are fraudulent, that leader should have the experiments repeated.
(B) A student should not be held accountable for implementing research principles with which the student was not familiar.
(C) Allowing the dissemination of data that are known to be fraudulent is just as reprehensible as the fraudulent generation of such data.
(D) A person who seeks to divert responsibility for a misdeed to a subordinate deserves chastisement for doing so.
(E) Final responsibility for the accuracy of the data produced from a research project belongs to the project's leader.",E
"Candidates running for office should pay close attention to voter survey results, because either the surveys are well-constructed, in which case candidates can learn about the populations they wish to represent, or the surveys are not well-constructed, in which case candidates can learn about the flaws in the survey procedure.
The principle underlying which one of the following is most similar to the principle underlying the argument above?
A) Cosmetologists should pay close attention to feedback given by consumers, because whether the feedback given is positive or it is negative, the cosmetologists can sometimes take appropriate steps to improve their work.
B) Research scientists should pay close attention to mixed experimental results, because the cause will be either that the reasoning they used to arrive at their hypothesis is incorrect, or that an assumption they make in their reasoning is incorrect.
C) Employees seeking promotions should pay close attention to their supervisor's comments, because either their supervisor is unhelpful, in which case the employees can learn about difficulties in the workplace, or the supervisor is helpful, in which case the employees can learn about the field in which they are trying to advance.
D) Students trying to pass a class generally pay close attention to their professor's comments, because either their professor is encouraging, in which case students who want to learn can keep trying, or their professor is discouraging, in which case students who do not want to learn can consider dropping the class.
E) Artists seeking national exposure should pay close attention to published criticism, because a critic either misunderstands an artist's work, in which case the artist can shrug it off, or the critic understands the work, in which case either a positive or a negative review will serve to draw attention to the art itself.",C
"Decreasing the populations of certain harmful insects in Arboria would undoubtedly assist current efforts to increase that region's fruit production. Pesticide CC25 is safe for birds and other animals, and is known to be effective against the major insect pests that threaten Arboria's fruit. Thus, if the practice of systematically using CC25 on Arboria's fruit trees is adopted, Arboria's fruit production can be expected to rise soon afterward.
Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the grounds for drawing the conclusion in the argument above?
A) Most of the fruit growers in Arboria refuse to use any pesticides on their fruit trees.
B) If insect populations decrease significantly, then birds that feed on insects and help to control the size of the insect population will leave Arboria.
C) The population of some of the insect pests in Arboria will remain constant in spite of the use of CC25.
D) Pollination of fruit tree flowers, a necessary step in fruit production, is effected only by certain insects that are highly susceptible to the lethal effects of CC25.
E) The populations of affected insect pests could eventually rise again due to the ability of most insect species to develop a resistance to pesticides.",D
"Condor chicks hatched in captivity but intended to be released into the wild are better off being reared by captive adult condors than by humans. Although the chicks are at greater risk of injury from adult condors than from trained humans, rearing by condors ultimately improves the survival rate of condors raised in captivity after they are released into the wild.
The above statements, if true, most strongly support which one of the following?
A) The survival in the wild of condors raised in captivity is easier to achieve than reducing the risk of injury to condor chicks being raised in captivity.
B) The survival rate of condors born in captivity is higher than that of condors born in the wild.
C) Captive condors raised in the wild use the same parenting techniques as condors raised in captivity.
D) For condor chicks born in captivity, exposure to adult condors is more important to the development of survival skills in the wild than is protection from adult condors.
E) Condors born in captivity only rarely survive after being released into the wild.",D
"If properly sited, designed, built, and operated, a septic tank provides a low-cost, reliable, and effective means for the safe disposal of normal household wastewater while posing almost no risk of groundwater contamination. The strict enforcement of stringent local sanitation codes mandating not only proper construction of such tanks but also their proper siting and design has resulted in virtually universal compliance with these codes. Nevertheless, septic tanks are the source of a significant and surprising number of cases of bacterial and viral contamination of groundwater.
If the statements above are true, which one of the following is most supported by them?
A) The cases of bacterial and viral contamination of groundwater that stem from septic tanks are often severe.
B) The number of septic tanks in use will decline as the number of cases of bacterial and viral contamination increases.
C) In those areas where septic tanks have been replaced by alternative wastewater disposal methods such as sewage systems, groundwater contamination no longer occurs.
D) Bacterial and viral contamination of groundwater, once discovered, can be cleared up at relatively low cost.
E) Not all of the people who discharge their household wastewater into septic tanks operate those tanks properly.",E
"The growth of the railroad system in Mundovia meant that many long trips previously taken by horse or horse-drawn carriage were instead taken by train. In the first several decades of the system's growth, however, horse traffic in and out of city centers did not decrease.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above?
A) Railroad terminals were usually located at a substantial distance from city centers.
B) Many people accustomed to traveling by horse did not like traveling on trains.
C) Horses frightened by trains sometimes caused serious accidents in large cities.
D) Initially, travel by train was more expensive than travel by horse.
E) Many long train trips were taken that would not have been attempted by horse.",A
"The coypu, a rodent native to South America, became a pest in eastern England after it was introduced there in the 1920s. In 1962 the British government, hoping to reduce the coypu population rapidly, began a program to trap coypus. However, the government's claim that its program caused that year's 90 percent reduction in the coypu population was unjustified since the first winter of the program was extremely cold, and the coypu cannot survive severely cold weather.
The argument proceeds by
A) questioning the accuracy of the government's claim that the coypu population declined by 90 percent after one year
B) suggesting that trapping alone would have made no significant difference in the coypu population
C) suggesting an alternative explanation for the rapid decline in the coypu population 
D) challenging the idea that the government was justified in reducing the coypu population as drastically and rapidly as it did
E) demonstrating that trapping was not the most effective measure the government could have taken to reduce the coypu population",C
