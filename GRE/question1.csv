"Patel: Although enrollment in the region's high school has been decreasing for several years, enrollment at the elementary school has grown considerably. Therefore, the regional school board proposes building a new elementary school. 
Quintero: Another solution would be to convert some high school classrooms temporarily into classrooms for elementary school students. 
Which of the following, if true, most helps to support Quintero's alternative proposal? 
(A) Some rooms at the high school cannot be converted into rooms suitable for the use of elementary school students. 
(B) The cost of building a high school is higher than the cost of building an elementary school. 
(C) Although the birth rate has not increased, the number of families sending their children to the region's high school has increased markedly. 
(D) A high school atmosphere could jeopardize the safety and self-confidence of elementary school students. 
(E) Even before the region's high school population began to decrease, several high school classrooms rarely needed to be used."	E
"Peter: More than ever before in Risland, college graduates with science degrees are accepting permanent jobs in other fields. That just goes to show that scientists in Risland are not being paid enough. 
Lila: No, it does not. These graduates are not working in science for the simple reason that there are not enough jobs in science in Risland to employ all of these graduates. Which of the following, if true in Risland, would most undermine the reasoning in Peter's argument? 
(A) The college graduates with science degrees who are not working in science are currently earning lower salaries than they would earn as scientists. 
(B) Fewer college students than ever before are receiving degrees in science. 
(C) The number of jobs in science has steadily risen in the last decade. 
(D) A significant number of college graduates with science degrees worked at low-paying jobs while they were in college. 
(E) Every year some recent college graduates with science degrees accept permanent jobs in nonscientific fields."	A
"Counselor: Every year a popular newsmagazine publishes a list of United States colleges, ranking them according to an overall numerical score that is a composite of ratings according to several criteria. However, the overall scores generally should not be used by students as the basis for deciding to which colleges to apply. 
Which of the following, if true, most helps to justify the counselor's recommendation? 
(A) The vast majority of people who purchase the magazine in which the list appears are not college-bound students. 
(B) Colleges that are ranked highest in the magazine's list use this fact in advertisements aimed at attracting students. 
(C) The rankings seldom change from one year to the next. 
(D) The significance that particular criteria have for any two students is likely to differ according to the students' differing needs. 
(E) Some college students who are pleased with their schools considered the magazine's rankings before deciding which college to attend."	D
"A thorough search of Edgar Allan Poe's correspondence has turned up not a single letter in which he mentions his reputed morphine addiction. On the basis of this evidence it is safe to say that Poe's reputation for having been a morphine addict is undeserved and that reports of his supposed addiction are untrue. 
Which of the following is assumed by the argument above? 
(A) Reports claiming that Poe was addicted to morphine did not begin to circulate until after his death. 
(B) None of the reports of Poe's supposed morphine addiction can be traced to individuals who actually knew Poe. 
(C) Poe's income from writing would not have been sufficient to support a morphine addiction. 
(D) Poe would have been unable to carry on an extensive correspondence while under the influence of morphine. 
(E) Fear of the consequences would not have prevented Poe from indicating in his correspondence that he was addicted to morphine."	E
"Adelle: The government's program to reduce the unemployment rate in the province of Carthena by encouraging job creation has failed, since the rate there has not changed appreciably since the program began a year ago. 
Fran: But the unemployment rate in Carthena had been rising for three years before the program began, so the program is helping.
Which of the following, if true, most strongly counters Fran's objection to Adelle's argument? 
(A) The government is advised by expert economists, some of whom specialize in employment issues. 
(B) The unemployment rate in the province of Carthena has historically been higher than that of the country as a whole. 
(C) The current government was elected by a wide margin, because of its promises to reduce the unemployment rate in Carthena. 
(D) Around the time the government program began, large numbers of unemployed Carthena residents began leaving the province to look for work elsewhere. 
(E) The unemployment rate in Carthena had been relatively stable until shortly before the current government took office."	D
"Soft Drink Manufacturer：Our new children's soft drink, RipeCal, is fortified with calcium. Since calcium is essential for developing healthy bones, drinking RipeCal regularly will help make children healthy. 
Consumer Advocate：But RipeCal also contains large amounts of sugar, and regularly consuming large amounts of sugar is unhealthful, especially for children. 
In responding to the soft drink manufacturer, the consumer advocate does which of the following？ 
(A)Challenges the manufacturer's claim about the nutritional value of calcium in children's diets 
(B)Argues that the evidence cited by the manufacturer, when properly considered, leads to a conclusion opposite to that reached by the manufacturer. 
(C)Implies that the manufacturer of a product is typically unconcerned with the nutritional value of that product. 
(D)Questions whether a substance that is healthful when eaten in moderation can be unhealthful when eaten in excessive amounts. 
(E)Presents additional facts that call into question the conclusion drawn by the manufacturer."	E
"Over a period of several months, researchers attached small lights to the backs of wetas—flightless insects native to New Zealand—enabling researchers for the first time to make comprehensive observations of the insects' nighttime activities.Thus, since wetas forage only at night, the researchers' observations will significantly improve knowledge of the normal foraging habits of wetas. 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends？ 
(A) Researchers were interested only in observing the wetas' foraging habits and so did not keep track of other types of behavior. 
(B) No pattern of behavior that is exhibited by wetas during the nighttime is also exhibited by wetas during the daytime. 
(C)Attaching the small lights to the wetas' backs did not greatly alter the wetas' normal nighttime foraging habits. 
(D)Wetas typically forage more frequently during the months in which the researchers studied them than they do at other times. 
(E)The researchers did not use other observational techniques to supplement their method of using small lights to track the nighttime behavior of wetas."	C
"People whose bodies cannot produce the substance cytochrome P450 are three times as likely to develop Parkinson's disease, a disease that affects the brain, as are people whose bodies do produce this substance. Since cytochrome P450 protects the brain from toxic chemicals, toxic chemicals probably play a role in the development of Parkinson's disease. 
Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the argument？ 
(A)It will soon be possible for cytochrome P450 to be synthesized for the treatment of people whose bodies cannot produce this substance. 
(B)Many people whose bodies are unable to produce cytochrome P450 lack the ability to produce certain other substances as well. 
(C)Cytochrome P450 has no effect on the brain other than to protect it from toxic chemicals. 
(D)People with Parkinson's disease often exhibit a marked lessening in the severity of their symptoms when they are treated with dopamine, a chemical produced naturally in the brain. 
(E)Many people with Parkinson's disease have the ability to produce cytochrome P450 naturally."	C
"The early universe contained only the lightest elements, hydrogen and helium. Heavier elements, such as carbon, form only in nuclear reactions in stars and are dispersed when the stars explode. A recently discovered gas cloud contained carbon several billion years ago, when the universe was no more than two billion years old. 
If the statements above are true, which of the following must, on the basis of them, also be true？ 
(A)The earliest stars contained only hydrogen. 
(B)Some stars were formed before the universe was two billion years old. 
(C)The carbon in the gas cloud later formed part of some stars. 
(D)No stars identified to date are as old as the gas cloud. 
(E)The gas cloud also contained hydrogen and helium."	B
"Sleep deprivation is a known cause of workplace error, and many physicians frequently go without sleep for periods of 24 hours or more. However, few of these physicians have, in the course of a routine examination by a peer, been diagnosed with sleep deprivation.So there is little cause for concern that habitual sleep deprivation will cause widespread physician error. 
The answer to which of the following questions would be most helpful in evaluating the argument？ 
(A)Do physicians who have been diagnosed with sleep disorders also show signs of other ills not related to sleep deprivation？ 
(B)Is the ability to recognize the symptoms of sleep deprivation in others significantly impaired by habitual sleep deprivation？ 
(C)Do factors other than habitual sleep deprivation ever lead to errors in the workplace on the part of physicians？ 
(D)Of people who have recently been treated by physicians, what percentage believe that many physicians have occasionally suffered from sleep deprivation？ 
(E)Is the incidence of sleep deprivation higher among physicians than it is among other health care workers？"	B
"A list of the fifteen operas most frequently performed in recent times includes no works by the nineteenthcentury German composer Richard Wagner. Although music producers tend to produce what audiences want, relative infrequency of performance probably does not indicate lack of popularity in Wagner's case, since Wagner's operas are notoriously expensive to perform on stage. 
Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the conclusion of the argument above？ 
(A)The list of most frequently performed operas does not include operas produced by small amateur groups. 
(B)Some opera companies are backed by patrons who are willing to commit large sums of money in order to enjoy lavish productions. 
(C)All of the fifteen most frequently performed operas of recent times are works that have been popular for at least 75 years. 
(D)More recordings have been produced recently of the works of Wagner than of the works of any other composer of opera. 
(E)Operatic works of all kinds have been increasing in popularity in recent years."	D
"The bodies of dwarf individuals of mammalian species are generally smaller in relation to those of nondwarf individuals than are the teeth of the dwarf individuals in relation to those of the nondwarf individuals. Fragmentary skeletal remains of an adult dwarf woolly mammoth were recently found. The teeth are three-fourths the size of the teeth of an average adult nondwarf woolly mammoth. 
The statements above, if true, most strongly support which of the following？ 
(A)The body of the dwarf woolly mammoth was less than three-fourths the size of the body of an average adult nondwarf woolly mammoth. 
(B)None of the teeth of the dwarf woolly mammoth that were recently discovered was as large as any of the teeth of nondwarf woolly mammoths that have been discovered. 
(C)The teeth of most adult dwarf individuals of mammalian species are three- fourths the size of the teeth of the adult nondwarf individuals of the same species. 
(D)Dwarf woolly mammoths had the same number of teeth as did nondwarf woolly mammoths. 
(E)Dwarf individuals of most mammalian species are generally no more than three-fourths the size of the adult nondwarf individuals of those species."	A
"Excluding purchases by businesses, the average amount spent on a factory-new car has risen 30 percent in the last five years. In the average household budget, the proportion spent on car purchases has remained unchanged in that period. Therefore the average household budget must have increased by 30 percent over the last five years. 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies？ 
(A)The average number of factory-new cars purchased per household has remained unchanged over the last five years. 
(B)The average amount spent per car by businesses buying factory-new cars has risen 30 percent in the last five years. 
(C)The proportion of the average household budget spent on all car-related expenses has remained unchanged over the last five years. 
(D)The proportion of the average household budget spent on food and housing has remained unchanged over the last five years. 
(E)The total amount spent nationwide on factorynew cars has increased by 30 percent over the last five years."	A
"Armtech, a temporary-employment agency, previously gave its employees 2.5 paid vacation days after each 700 hours worked. Armtech's new policy is to give its employees 5.0 paid vacation days after each 1,200 hours worked. Therefore, this new policy is more generous to Armtech employees in giving them more vacation days per hour worked than the old policy did. 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends？ 
(A) Most current Armtech employees approve of the company's new vacation policy. 
(B) A few Armtech employees leave the company before having worked 700 hours. 
(C) Most Armtech employees were not aware that the company planned to change its vacation policy until after it had already done so. 
(D) A significant portion of Armtech employees stay with the company long enough to work for 1,200 hours. 
(E) Armtech's new vacation policy closely matches the vacation policies of competing temporary employment agencies."	D
"The global population of frogs has declined in recent years while the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth has increased. Since the genetic material in frog eggs is harmed when exposed to ultraviolet radiation, and since the eggs themselves are not protected by shells or leathery coverings but are gelatinous, the frog population decline is probably due, at least in part, to the ultraviolet radiation increase. 
Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest support for the argument？ 
(A) Even in those regions where there has been no significant increase in ultraviolet radiation, only a small proportion of the frog eggs that are laid ever hatch. 
(B) In areas where there has been the least decline in frog populations, populations of species of insects that frogs eat have decreased. 
(C) The eggs of frog species whose populations are declining tend to have higher concentrations of damaging pesticides than do the eggs of frog species whose populations have not declined. 
(D) In many places where turtles, which lay eggs with tough, leathery coverings, share habitats with frogs, turtle populations are also in decline. 
(E) Populations of frog species that hide their eggs beneath rocks or under sand have declined considerably less than have populations of frog species that do not cover their eggs."	E
"To improve productivity, manufacturing companies have recently begun restructuring work to produce more goods with fewer assembly-line workers, and the companies have laid off many workers as a consequence. The workers laid off have been those with the least seniority(time on the job), generally the younger workers. 
The statements above, if true, most strongly support which of the following as a conclusion？ 
(A) The products manufactured by the companies are not undergoing design changes while the manufacturing jobs are being restructured. 
(B) When assembly-line workers have made suggestions for improvements in manufacturing processes, some suggestions have been implemented, but many have not. 
(C) Assembly-line workers now need increased reading and mathematical skills to do their jobs. 
(D) Some of the innovations in assembly-line processes and procedures that were made to increase productivity have instead proved to be counterproductive. 
(E) The manufacturing companies are increasing the average age of their assembly-line workforce while still seeking to increase production."	E
"During the nineteenth century, Britain's urban population increased as its rural population diminished. A historian theorizes that, rather than industrialization's being the cause, this change resulted from a series of migrations to urban areas, each occasioned by a depression in the agrarian economy. To test this hypothesis, the historian will compare economic data with population census data. 
The historian's hypothesis would be most strongly supported if which of the following were found to be true？ 
(A) The periods of greatest growth in the industrial economy were associated with a relatively rapid decline in the rural population. 
(B) The periods of greatest weakness in the agrarian economy were associated with relatively slow growth in the population as a whole. 
(C) Periods when the agrarian economy was comparatively strong and the industrial economy comparatively weak were associated with a particularly rapid decline in the rural population. 
(D) Periods when the agrarian and industrial economies were both strong were associated with particularly rapid growth in the urban population. 
(E) The periods of greatest strength in the agrarian economy were associated with relatively slow growth in the urban population."	E
"Politician：Each year, small businesses create more jobs than do large established businesses. Therefore, in order to reduce unemployment in the long term, we should provide incentives for starting small businesses rather than for expanding established large businesses. 
Which of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the politician's argument？ 
(A) In general, people employed by small businesses report higher job satisfaction than do people employed by large businesses. 
(B) Among the currently unemployed are many people with sufficient job skills to perform the jobs that small businesses would create. 
(C) Providing an effective incentive for starting a business generally costs significantly less than providing an effective incentive for expanding a large business. 
(D) A high proportion of small businesses fail within three years of starting because of their owners' inexperience. 
(E) The average large business contributes more money to politicians’ campaign funds than the average small business does."	D
"In the workplace, influenza is typically spread by infected individuals to others with whom they work in close quarters. A new medication that suppresses the symptoms of influenza therefore will actually increase the number of influenza cases, because this medication will allow people who would otherwise be home in bed to return to work while infected. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously challenges the prediction？ 
(A) Coughing, a symptom of influenza that the new medication suppresses, is a primary mechanism in the spread of this illness. 
(B) Some medications that are used to suppress symptoms of influenza are also used by many people to treat symptoms that are caused not by influenza but by other illnesses. 
(C) Many workers who now remain at home when infected with influenza do so because the symptoms of influenza prevent them from performing their jobs effectively. 
(D) Most adults who are immunized against influenza in order to avoid being infected are over 65 years old and retired and thus do not work outside the home. 
(E) Symptoms of an illness are often the body's means of curing itself of the illness, and therefore suppression of symptoms can prolong the illness that causes them."	A
"Editorial：Critics of nuclear power complain about the allegedly serious harm that might result from continued operation of existing nuclear power plants. But such concerns do not justify closing these plants；after all, their operation has caused no more harm than that caused by pollution generated by coal-and oil-burning power plants, the most important other sources of energy.
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends？ 
(A) Existing nuclear power plants should be closed only if it can be conclusively demonstrated that their continued operation is likely to cause harm more serious than the harm their operation has already caused. 
(B) Closing existing nuclear power plants would require greatly increased reliance on coal-and oil-burning power plants. 
(C) The harm that has resulted from operation of existing coal-and oil-burning power plants has been significant. 
(D) The harm that a nuclear power plant is likely to cause as it continues to operate can be reliably predicted from the past history of nuclear power plants. 
(E) The only harm that has resulted from operation of existing coal-and oil-burning power plants has resulted from the pollution generated by these plants."	D
"Drug manufacturer: Although our company requires that patients who use our new drug also purchase from us nonreusable kits for weekly blood testing, the expense of those kits is an entirely necessary one: weekly blood testing must be done to monitor the drug's potential side effects, which can be very dangerous. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the manufacturer's argument? 
(A) The expense of purchasing the blood-test kits has not prevented any patients from obtaining them or the drug. 
(B) Medical laboratories can perform the blood testing at a lower cost to patients or their insurers than the price the manufacturer charges for the kits. 
(C) A one-year supply of the drug and the weekly blood-test kits can cost patients or their insurers over $10,000. 
(D) Most government and other health insurance programs will not reimburse patients for the full cost of both the drug and the blood-test kits. 
(E) Patients who suffer one or more of the dangerous side effects of the drug can incur heavy expenses for the treatment of those side effects."	B
"Virginia and her brother William disagree over when their father was born: Virginia claims it was in 1935 and William claims it was in 1933. The hospital where their father was born has no records for 1933 but has complete records for 1935—records that do not include a birth record for their father. Therefore, he must have been born in 1933. 
The argument depends on which of the following assumptions? 
(A) Either Virginia's claim or William's claim is correct. 
(B) The records of the hospital where their father was born date back to 1933. 
(C) Virginia and William know the day and the month of their father's birth.

(E) None of their other relatives knows the year in which Virginia and William's father was born."	A
"The town of San Leonardo has recently enacted a law banning smoking in all restaurants within town limits. Since many smokers who normally dine in San Leonardo's restaurants will not want to refrain from smoking during their meals, San Leonardo's restaurants will undoubtedly lose many patrons and considerable income. 
Which of the following, if true, most helps to strengthen the argument above? 
(A) Most residents of San Leonardo who eat in restaurants are not smokers. 
(B) Most smokers who dine in the company of nonsmokers are willing to refrain from smoking during their meals. 
(C) If the law banning smoking in restaurants had not been enacted, it is likely that a more stringent law banning smoking in all public places in San Leonardo would have been enacted instead. 
(D) Prior to the enactment of the law banning smoking in San Leonardo's restaurant, the town had a law that required most restaurants to have nonsmoking sections. 
(E) None of the other communities adjacent to San Leonardo, which have restaurants comparable to those of San Leonardo, has enacted and enforces any antismoking legislation."	E
"Children whose biological parents both have Tic Syndrome Z (TSZ), which is characterized by the involuntary contraction of certain muscles, are about four times more likely to develop such contractions than are children whose biological parents do not have TSZ, It is likely, therefore, that predisposition to TSZ is an inherited trait. 
Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the conclusion above? 
(A) Children whose parents have TSZ are more likely to develop TSZ if they are under unusual stress at school or at home than if they are not under such stress. 
(B) Children whose biological parents do not have TSZ are more likely to develop TSZ if they are raised by adoptive parents with TSZ than if they are raised by their biological parents. 
(C) Children whose biological parents have TSZ are as likely to develop TSZ if they are raised by adoptive parents who do not have TSZ as if they are raised by their biological parents. 
(D) Children whose biological parents have TSZ and who develop TSZ usually avoid developing a severe form of the syndrome if they seek treatment for TSZ shortly after developing the first signs of it. 
(E) Children with TSZ whose biological parents do not have TSZ are less likely to have the syndrome diagnosed when symptoms first appear than are children with TSZ whose biological parents have TSZ."	C
"Playing eighteenth-century music on the instruments of that period provides valuable information about how the music originally sounded. Eighteenth-century instruments cannot be played without being restored, however, and restoring such an instrument destroys all of the information that researchers could obtain from it about eighteenth-century instrument-making techniques.
If the statements above are true, which of the following must be true on the basis of them? 
(A) Eighteenth-century instruments cannot be used to provide information about the original techniques used in playing such instruments if they have been restored. 
(B) Eighteenth-century instruments that have been restored can provide information only about how eighteenth-century music originally sounded 
(C) Eighteenth-century instruments are the only source of information about the instrument-making techniques of that period. 
(D) An eighteenth-century instrument that has not been restored can provide more information than can one that has been restored. 
(E) An eighteenth-century instrument cannot serve as a source of new information about eighteenth-century instrument-making techniques once it can be played"	E
"A new and more aggressive form of the fungus that caused the Irish potato famine of the nineteenth century has recently arisen. However, since this new form of the fungus can be killed by increased application of currently used fungicides, it is unlikely that the fungus will cause widespread food shortages in countries that currently rely on potatoes for sustenance. 
Which of the following, if true, most calls into question the conclusion in the argument above? 
(A) Though potatoes are an important staple crop in many parts of the world, people in most countries rely primarily on wheat or rice for sustenance. 
(B) Potato farmers in many countries to which the new form of the fungus has spread cannot afford to increase their spending on fungicides. 
(C) The new form of the fungus first began to spread when contaminated potato seeds were inadvertently exported from a major potato-exporting country. 
(D) Potato farmers in most countries use several insecticides on their crops in addition to fungicides of the sort that kill the new form of the fungus. 
(E) Most governments have funds set aside that can be used to alleviate the effects of large-scale disasters such as severe food shortages and floods."	B
"As government agencies, faced with budget difficulties, reduce their funding for scientific research, a greater amount of such research is being funded by private foundations. This shift means that research projects likely to produce controversial results will almost certainly comprise a smaller proportion of all funded research projects, since private foundations, concerned about their public image, tend to avoid controversy. 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
(A) Only research that is conducted without concern for the possibility of generating controversy is likely to produce scientifically valid results. 
(B) Private foundations that fund scientific research projects usually recognize that controversial results from those projects cannot always be avoided. 
(C) Scientists who conduct research projects funded by private foundations are unlikely to allow the concerns of the funding organizations to influence the manner in which they conduct the research. 
(D) Many government agencies are more concerned about their public image than are most private foundations. 
(E) Government agencies are more willing than are private foundations to fund research projects that are likely to produce controversial results."	E
"Juries in criminal trials do not base verdicts on uncorroborated testimony given by any one witness. Rightly so, because it is usually prudent to be highly skeptical of unsubstantiated claims made by any one person. But then, to be consistent, juries should end an alltoo-common practice: convicting defendants on the basis of an uncorroborated full confession. 
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument above? 
(A) Juries often acquit in cases in which a defendant retracts a full confession made before trial. 
(B) The process of jury selection is designed to screen out people who have a firm opinion about the defendant's guilt in advance of the trial. 
(C) Defendants sometimes make full confessions when they did in fact do what they are accused of doing and have come to believe that the prosecutor has compelling proof of this. 
(D) Highly suggestible people who are accused of wrongdoing sometimes become so unsure of their own recollection of the past that they can come to accept the accusations made against them. 
(E) Many people believe that juries should not convict defendants who have not made a full confession."	D
"Although spinach is rich in calcium, it also contains large amounts of oxalic acid, a substance that greatly impedes calcium absorption by the body. Therefore, other calcium-containing foods must be eaten either instead of or in addition to spinach if a person is to be sure of getting enough calcium. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argu-ment above? 
(A)Rice, which does not contain calcium, counteracts the effects of oxalic acid on calcium absorption. 
(B) Dairy products, which contain even more calcium than spinach does, are often eaten by people who eat spinach on a regularbasis. 
(C) Neither the calcium nor the oxalic acid in spinach is destroyed when spinach is cooked. 
(D) Many leafy green vegetables other than spinach that are rich in calcium also contain high concentrations of oxalic acid. 
(E) Oxalic acid has little effect on the body's ability to absorb nutrients other than calcium."	A
"Joyce: Three years ago the traffic commission modified our town's busiest intersection for better visibility, a commendable effort to cut down on traffic accidents there. 
Gary: Over the past three years there have been more, not fewer, traffic accidents per week at that intersection, so the modification has increased the likelihood of accidents there 
The answer to which of the following questions would be most useful in evaluating Gary's argument? 
(A) What proportion of the town's drivers involved in accidents that occurred prior to the modification suffered personal injury in their accidents? 
(B) How long, on average, had the members of the traffic commission held their offices when the modification was implemented? 
(C) Do a majority of the town's residents approve of the traffic commission's overall performance?

(E) How has the volume of traffic at the town's busiest intersection changed over the last three years?"	E
"Women make up the majority of the population in the country, and many of the prescriptions written by doctors for tranquilizers are for women patients. The testing of these drugs for efficacy and the calibration of recommended doses, however, was done only on men. Not even the animals used to test toxicity were female. 
The statements above, if true, best support which of the following as a conclusion? 
(A) Some tranquilizers are more appropriately prescribed for women than for men. 
(B) There have been no reports of negative side effects from prescribed tranquilizers in women 
(C) Tranquilizers are prescribed for patients in some instances when doctors do not feel confident of their diagnoses. 
(D) The toxicity of drugs to women is less than the toxicity of the same drugs to men. 
(E) Whether the recommended dosages of tranquilizers are optimal for women is not known."	E
"Gray wolves have been absent from a large national park for decades. Park officials wish to reestablish the wolves without jeopardizing any existing species of wildlife there. Since the park contains adequate prey for the wolves and since the wolves avoid close contact with people, reintroducing them would serve the officials' purpose without seriously jeopardizing visitors' safety. 
Each of the following, if true, strengthens the argument above EXCEPT: 
(A) The park is so large that wolves will not need to venture into areas frequented by people. 
(B) Rabies is very rare in wolves, and there have been no verified cases of serious human injuries from nonrabid wild wolves since records have been kept. 
(C) Ranchers in the region near the park have expressed concern that gray wolves, if reintroduced, would sometimes prey on their livestock. 
(D) Predation by gray wolves on elk in the park is likely to improve the health and viability of the park's elk population as a whole by reducing malnutrition among the elk. 
(E) Wolves do not prey on animals of any endangered species that currently inhabit the park."	C
"Osteoporosis is a disease that reduces bone mass, leading to fragile bones that break easily. Current treatments for osteoporosis such as estrogen or calcitonin help prevent further loss of bone but do not increase bone mass. Since fluoride is known to increase bone mass, administering fluoride to osteoporosis patients would therefore help make their bones less susceptible to breaking. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above? 
(A) Most people who suffer from osteoporosis are not aware that administration of fluoride can increase bone mass. 
(B) Fluoride is added to drinking water in many locations in order to strengthen the teeth of people who drink the water. 
(C) The risk of contracting osteoporosis and other degenerative bone diseases is lessened by exercise and an adequate intake of calcium. 
(D) Unlike administration of fluoride, administration of estrogen or calcitonin is known to cause undesirable side effects for many people. 
(E) The new bone mass that is added by the administration of fluoride is more brittle and less elastic than normal bone tissue."	E

Which of the following can be properly concluded from the statements above? 
(A) Toutatis is more likely to collide with the Earth than Gaspra is. 
(B) Toutatis, unlike Gaspra, has only recently been discovered. 
(C) Asteroids can be photographed only by using ground-based radar.

(E) The photograph of Gaspra was not taken using ground-based radar."	E
"Which of the following most logically completes the argument below? 
Alone among living species, human beings experience adolescence, a period of accelerated physical growth prior to full maturity. Whether other hominid species, which are now all extinct and are known only through the fossil record, went through adolescence cannot be known, since 
(A) the minimum acceleration in physical growth that would indicate adolescence might differ according to species 
(B) the fossil record, though steadily expanding, will always remain incomplete 
(C) detecting the adolescent growth spurt requires measurements on the same individual at different ages 
(D) complete skeletons of extinct hominids are extremely rare 
(E) human beings might be the first species to benefit from the survival advantages, if any, conferred by adolescence"	C
"Fossils of the coral Acrocora palmata that date from the last period when glaciers grew and consequently spread from the polar regions are found at ocean depths far greater than those at which A. palmata can now survive. Therefore, although the fossilized A. palmata appears indistinguishable from A. palmata now living, it must have differed in important respects to have been able to live in deep water. 
The argument depends on the assumption that 
(A) no fossils of the coral A. palmata have been found that date from periods when glaciers were not spreading from the polar regions 
(B) geological disturbances since the last period during which glaciers spread have caused no major downward shift in the location of A. palmata fossils 
(C) A. palmata now live in shallow waters in most of the same geographical regions as those in which deep-lying A. palmata fossils have been found 
(D) A. palmata fossils have been found that date from each of the periods during which glaciers are known to have spread from the polar region 
(E) A. palmata can live at greater depths where the ocean temperature is colder than they can where the ocean temperature is warmer"	B
"Conservationists have believed that by concentrating their preservation efforts on habitats rich in an easily surveyed group of species, such as birds, they would thereby be preserving areas rich in overall species diversity. This belief rests on a view that a geographical area rich in one group of species will also be rich in the other groups characteristic of the entire regional climate zone.
Which of the following findings about widely scattered tracts 10 kilometers by 10 kilometers in a temperate climate zone would most seriously challenge the conservationists' assumptions? 
(A) The tracts show little damage from human intrusion and from pollution by human activities. 
(B) Where a certain group of species, such as birds, is abundant, there is also an abundance of the species, such as insects, on which that group of species feeds, or in the case of plants, of the land and water resources it requires. 
(C) The area of one of the tracts is generally large enough to contain a representative sample of the organisms in the region. 
(D) There is little overlap between the list of tracts that are rich in species of butterflies and the list of those that are rich in species of birds. 
(E) The highest concentration of individuals of rare species is found where the general diversity of species is greatest."	D
"Drug companies lose money when manufacturing drugs that cure those suffering from rare diseases because selling a drug to only a few people usually does not recoup manufacturing expenses．Therefore, a company manufacturing any of the drugs that cure those suffering from loxemia, an extremely rare disease, will undoubtedly lose money． 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the conclusion above？ 
(A)Several drugs that cure those suffering from loxemia also cure those suffering from very common illnesses．
(B)Most of those who contract loxemia also contract another illness concurrently． 
(C)Most of the drug companies that manufacture drugs that cure rare diseases do not manufacture drugs that cure loxemia． 
(D)A sizable number of people are afflicted with one or another rare disease even though each rare disease afflicts only a small number of people．
(E)The larger the amount of a drug that is manufactured, the lower the manufacturing expense for each unit of the drug that is produced．"	A
"The tomb of a warrior killed in 1501 bears a sculpted portrait depicting him dressed for battle．Some historians attribute the portrait to an artist from that century, but of the many references to the tomb in surviving documents, none that predates the 1800's mentions the portrait．The portrait is therefore more likely the work of a much later artist． 
Which of the following, if true, would also support the conclusion of the argument if substituted for the evidence given concerning the portrait？ 
(A)The portrait of the warrior was commissioned by the family of the warrior's widow． 
(B)References in surviving documents mention that an artist was paid in 1525 for an unspecified number of works for the church in which the tomb is located 
(C)The warrior is depicted in the portrait as wearing boots made of a material not used for boots until the 1700's． 
(D)Some other art treasures from the church in which the tomb is located have been reliable dated to the 1400's．
(E)The portrait of the warrior on the tomb strongly resembles a portrait of him known to have been completed during his lifetime．"	C
"Scientist：More than 1, 000 large asteroids regularly cross the Earth's path．Even though the probability of one colliding with the Earth is extremely slight, we should do whatever we can to reduce that probability since any such collision would be catastrophic．The best way to avoid such a disaster is to deflect the asteroids．The only known way of deflecting asteroids is by hitting them with nuclear weapons that would be stored in space stations． 
The scientist’s claims are structured so as to lead to which of the following conclusions？ 
(A)Nuclear technology is the only technology that can plausibly be used to prevent natural catastrophes． 
(B)Nuclear weapons should be deployed in space． 
(C)No catastrophe has yet been caused by the collision of an asteroid with the Earth． 
(D)The 1, 000 large asteroids that cross the Earth's path pose only an extremely slight risk of colliding with the Earth． 
(E)There is currently no acceptable use to which nuclear weapons can be put, aside from protecting the Earth from asteroids"	B
"It has long been thought that high levels of the hormone testosterone contribute to the onset of heart disease in men．However, this view cannot be correct, since men who have heart disease typically show significantly lower levels of testosterone than do men who have not had heart disease． 
The argument above assumes which of the following？ 
(A)Many men who have never had heart disease have unusually low levels of testosterone． 
(B)Having heart disease does not significantly lower the level of testosterone in men． 
(C)Levels of hormones other than testosterone significantly affect the likelihood that a man will develop heart disease． 
(D)Heart disease and lowered testosterone levels in men are the effects of a single common cause． 
(E)High levels of testosterone have never been thought to contribute to a serious disease other than heart disease．"	B
"People who engage in scuba diving are healthier, on average, than people who do not engage in this activity．Therefore, scuba diving tends to promote improved health．
The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it 
(A)presupposes that everyone who takes up scuba diving does so solely for health reasons 
(B)leads to a further and falsifiable conclusion that no one can achieve good health without engaging in scuba diving 
(C)fails to point out that a small number of people are seriously injured in scuba diving accidents each year 
(D)treats a precondition for improving one's health as though it were something that by itself could ensure good health 
(E)overlooks the possibility that people generally do not take up scuba diving unless they are in good health"	E
"Which of the following most logically completes the argument below？ In recent years, the proportion of car buyers who buy new cars rather than used cars has declined．Some consumers have attributed this change to an increase in new-car prices．As evidence of the price increase, they cite figures that show that, even adjusting for inflation, the price that the buyer of a new car pays, on average, is far higher now than a few years ago． 
This evidence is unpersuasive, however, because 
(A)the value of a car that is bought new declines much more rapidly than does the value of a car that is bought used 
(B)after someone has bought a car, it might be several years before that person next buys a car 
(C)a decline in the proportion of car buyers who buy new cars must necessarily mean that the proportion who buy used cars has increased 
(D)the relative increase in used-car sales might be explained by the decisions of only a small proportion of all car buyers 
(E)the change in the average price paid for a new car could result solely from more people's rejecting inexpensive new cars in favor of used cars"	E
"In Bassaria a group of that country's most senior judges has criticized the uniform mandatory sentences recently introduced for certain specific crimes．The judges argue that such sentences, by depriving them of all discretion in setting sentences, make it impossible for them to consider either aggravating or extenuating circumstances and so make it impossible to achieve true justice―the fitting of the severity of the punishment to the gravity of the particular crime． 
Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest evidence for the claim that in Bassaria the newly introduced mandatory sentences are not necessarily a change for the worse with respect to achieving true justice as defined in the argument？ 
(A)Before mandatory sentencing, judges in eastern Bassaria imposed strikingly different sentences from those in western Bassaria for equally grave instances of the same kind of offense． 
(B)In Bassaria the frequency of crimes that have been made subject to mandatory sentences is lower now than it was just prior to the introduction of mandatory sentencing． 
(C)The law introducing mandatory sentences was passed in the legislature of Bassaria by a large majority and is unlikely to be repealed in the foreseeable future． 
(D)There used to be a wide difference between the minimum and the maximum sentences allowed by law in cases of crimes now subject to mandatory sentences． 
(E)In Bassaria judges are appointed for life and are thus not easily influenced by political pressure groups．"	A
"Each of two particular inspection systems that are based on different principles would detect all product flaws but would also erroneously reject three percent of flawless products．Assuming there is no overlap between the products erroneously rejected by the two systems and also no interference between the systems if both operate, using both systems and rejecting only those products found flawed by both would be a way of avoiding all erroneous rejections．
Which of the following most precisely characterizes the reasoning in the argument？ 
(A)The reasoning is conclusive, that is, the conclusion cannot be false if the statements offered in its support are true． 
(B)The reasoning is strong but not conclusive, if the statements offered in support of the conclusion are true, they provide good grounds for that conclusion, though it is possible that additional information might weaken the argument． 
(C)The reasoning is weak; the statements offered in support of the conclusion, though relevant to it, by themselves provide at best inadequate grounds for the conclusion． 
(D)The reasoning is flawed in that the conclusion is no more than a paraphrase of one of the pieces of evidence offered in its support． 
(E)The reasoning is flawed in that the argument treats evidence that a factor is necessary to bring about an event as if it were evidence that the factor is sufficient to bring about that event．"	A
"In recent years, there has been a dramatic decline in the population of the shrike, a predatory bird that inhabits flat land, such as farms and pastures. Some ornithologists hypothesize that this decline is due to the introduction of new, more effective pesticides to control the insect species on which shrikes prey. 
The answer to which of the following questions is NOT relevant to evaluating the ornithologists' hypothesis? 
(A) Was there a decline in the shrike population before the new pesticides were first used? 
(B) Have shrike populations declined significantly in those habitats where the new pesticides have not been used? 
(C) Have the new pesticides more significantly reduced the population of insect species on which shrikes prey than did the pesticides previously used? 
(D) Are insects that have consumed the new pesticides more toxic to the shrikes that eat those insects than were insects that consumed the less effective pesticides? 
(E) Are the new pesticides considered by most people to be less harmful to the environment than the old pesticides were considered to be?"	E
"Census data for Prenland show that unmarried Prenlandic men in their thirties outnumber unmarried Prenlandic women in that age group by about ten to One. Most of these men do wish to marry. Clearly, however, unless many of them marry women who are not Prenlandic, all but a minority will remain unmarried. 
The argument makes which of the following assumptions? 
(A) Emigration from Preland is more common among women than among men. 
(B) A greater proportion of Prelandic women in their thirties than of Prenlandic men of the same age would prefer to remain unmarried. 
(C) It is unlikely that many of these unmarried Prenlandic men will marry women more than a few years older than themselves. 
(D) Prenland has a high rate of divorce. 
(E) Most of the unmarried Prenlandic men are unwilling to marry women who are not Prenlandic."	C
"Certain extremely harmful bacteria found only in sewage are difficult to detect directly. Testing for E. coli, an easily detected and less harmful type of bacteria, in ocean water would be a reliable way of determining whether or not these more harmful bacteria are present, since ocean water contains E. Coli only if the water is contaminated with sewage that contains the harmful bacteria. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? 
(A) There are many different strains of the E. coli bacteria, and only some of these strains are harmful. 
(B) Some types of bacteria found in sewage are neither disease-causing nor difficult to detect directly. 
(C) Some of the types of bacteria found in sewage along with E. coli are not harmful to people unless the bacteria are ingested in large quantities. 
(D) E. coli dies out much more quickly than some of the more harmful bacteria found in sewage and then can no longer be easily detected. 
(E) Some of the types of bacteria found in sewage along with E. coli reproduce at a slower rate than E. coli."	D
"The organizers of tomorrow's outdoor concert announced that it will go on tomorrow on schedule unless bad weather is forecast or too few advance tickets are sold. If the concert is canceled, refunds will be made to ticket holders. Since some ticket holders have already been issued refunds even though more than enough advance tickets were sold, it must be the case that bad weather is forecast. 
Which of the following is an error of reasoning contained in the argument? 
(A) It proceeds as if a condition, which by itself is enough to guarantee a certain result, is the only condition under which that result would occur. 
(B) It bases a conclusion that is known to require two conditions on evidence that bears on only one of those conditions. 
(C) It explains one event as being caused by another event, even though both events must actually have been caused by some third, unidentified event. 
(D) It treats evidence for the absence of one condition under which a circumstance would occur as conclusive evidence that that circumstance will not occur. 
(E) Evidence given to support the conclusion actually undermines it."	A
"Although the prevailing supposition has been that it is too hot for microorganisms to survive deep below the Earth's surface, some scientists argue that there are living communities of microorganisms there that have been cut off from surface life for millions of years. These scientists base their argument on the discovery of living microorganisms in samples of material that were taken from holes drilled as deep as 1.74 miles. 
The scientists' argument depends on which of the following assumptions? 
(A)The microorganisms brought up were of a species that is related to those previously known to science. 
(B)No holes have been drilled into the Earth's surface to a distance deeper than 1.74 miles 
(C)The microorganisms did not come from surface soil that came into contact with the drilling equipment. 
(D) The stratum from which the samples came has been below the surface of the Earth ever since the Earth came into existence. 
(E) The temperature at the bottom of the holes drilled was not significantly hotter than that of the hottest spots on the Earth's surface."	C
"For 20 years all applicants for jobs as technicians at EquipCorp were required to demonstrate that they could operate and repair the machinery that was central to EquipCorp's manufacturing business. Now, however, that particular machinery is obsolete, and very different machinery fills the central role. Therefore, the old requirement is no longer a useful method for evaluating whether applicants for jobs as technicians at EquipCorp have the skills necessary for the job. 
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
(A) The machinery that is now obsolete was used by a large number of manufacturing companies before it became obsolete. 
(B) Among the people already holding jobs as technicians at Equip Corp, those who are most skillful at operating the new machinery had been some of the least skillful at operating the old machinery 
(C) Most people applying for jobs as technicians today have much broader skills than did people applying for jobs as technicians 20 years ago. 
(D) The skills required to operate and repair the obsolete machinery are useful in operating and maintaining many other types of machinery at EquipCorp that are not obsolete. 
(E) Much of the machinery that EquipCorp now uses in manufacturing is very likely to become obsolete within the next 20 years."	B
"The university's constitution defines the powers of two governing bodies．The general council, which currently retains authority over constitutional matters, consists of all the university's living alumni．The twenty-member senate decides routine matters by majority vote．A new proposal suggests making a unanimous vote in the senate sufficient to change the constitution． 
If the statements above are true, which of the following must follow on the basis of them？
(A) The proposal will take effect only if it receives the senate's unanimous support． 
(B) Currently each member of the senate has power of veto over any proposal that comes before that body． 
(C) Adopting the proposal would allow passage of constitutional changes without the general council's approval．

"Comparison of the growth rings of ancient trees enables scientists to determine from a piece of timber the year in which the tree used for the timber was felled．Hence, by analyzing the growth rings in timber surviving from ancient buildings, archaeologists can determine precisely when those buildings were constructed． 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends？ 
(A) The timber used for construction purposes in ancient times was made from very old trees． 
(B) The timber that was used in ancient building construction had not, prior to being used in the construction of the buildings, lain unused for an indeterminable amount of time． 
(C) The growth rings of any tree felled in a given year are identical to the growth rings of any other tree felled in that year． 
(D) The oldest of the ancient buildings that survive to the present day were constructed of the most durable woods． 
(E) Ancient builders did not use more than one type of wood for the construction of a given building"	B
"Color-tinting of movies originally photographed in black-and-white is inappropriate．Hundreds of the original artistic choices would have been made differently had these movies been filmed in color． Lighting on the sets of these movies was arranged to make highlights and shadows look right in black-and-white． 
Which of the following claims, if substituted for the claim about the lighting of movie sets, would lend the same type of support to the argument above？ 
(A) An important part of what gives these movies their identity is the result of the black-andwhite format． 
(B) Color film would have better captured the filmmakers' intentions． 
(C) Color film is superior to black-and-white film for making movies． 
(D) Makeup for the actors was applied so as to look best in black-and-white films． 
(E) The choice of black-and-white film over color film is entirely a matter of taste．"	D
"In Borkland, university scholarship stipends worth ＄4.2 million were unclaimed last year because several scholarship programs attracted no applicants who met the programs' qualifying criteria．This is an egregious waste of funds in a country where thousands of promising students each year cannot afford tuition．Qualifying criteria for those scholarships, therefore, should be revised． 
Which of the following, if true about Borkland, most strongly supports the conclusion drawn above？ 
(A) Many scholarships are unclaimed not because their qualifying criteria are too restrictive but because the scholarship programs rarely announce the scholarships' availability． 
(B) Because of inflation, the stipends offered by certain scholarship programs now appear less attractive to potential applicants than they did when they were first offered． 
(C) A significant number of scholarship programs awarded all of their available scholarship stipends last year, yet most of those programs have very restrictive qualifying criteria． 
(D) Certain scholarship programs accept applications only from students enrolled in specific major fields of study, but Borkland's universities no longer offer courses in the fields specified by many of those programs． 
(E) Several scholarship programs have found it impossible to revise their qualifying criteria without engaging in lengthy and costly legal proceedings．"	D
"In Diersville the new Environmental Action party won two seats on the seven-member town council in 1988．It lost both of those seats in the 1992 election, even though the party's pro-environment platform had essentially remained unchanged．This decline in the party's fortunes clearly demonstrates that in Diersville environmental concerns faded in significance between 1988 and 1992．
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument？ 
(A) Between 1988 and 1992, the number of eligible voters in Diersville rose, but not the percentage who actually voted． 
(B) Between 1988 and 1992, Diersville's leading political party revised its platform, adopting a strongly environmentalist stance． 
(C) The parties that ran candidates in the 1992 election in Diersville were the same as those that had done so in the 1988 election． 
(D) In 1992 the Environmental Action party won fewer votes in Diersville than it had won in 1988． 
(E) Between 1988 and 1992, some measures intended to benefit the environment had been adopted by the town council, but with inconclusive results．"	B
"The United States is not usually thought of as a nation of parakeet lovers．Yet in a census of parakeet owners in selected comparable countries, the United States ranked second, with eleven parakeet owners per hundred people．The conclusion can be drawn from this that people in the United States are more likely to own parakeets than are people in most other countries． 
Knowledge of which of the following would be most useful in judging the accuracy of the conclusion？ 
(A) The number of parakeets in the United States． 
(B) The number of parakeet owners in the United States． 
(C) The number of parakeet owners per hundred people in the country that ranked first in the census．

"Until 1984 only aspirin and acetaminophen shared the lucrative nonprescription pain-reliever market． In 1984, however, ibuprofen was expected to account for fifteen percent of all nonprescription pain-reliever sales．On that basis business experts predicted for 1984 a corresponding fifteen percent decrease in the combined sales of aspirin and acetaminophen． 
The prediction mentioned in the last sentence above was based on which of the following assumptions？ 
(A) Most consumers would prefer ibuprofen to both aspirin and acetaminophen． 
(B) Aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen all relieve headache pain and muscular aches, but aspirin and ibuprofen can also cause stomach irritation． 
(C) Before 1984 ibuprofen was available only as a prescription medicine． 
(D) The companies that manufacture and sell aspirin and acetaminophen would not also manufacture and sell ibuprofen． 
(E) The introduction of ibuprofen would not increase total sales of nonprescription pain reliever．"	E
"New regulations in Mullentown require manufacturers there to develop five-year pollution-reduction plans. The regulations require that each manufacturer develop a detailed plan for reducing its released pollutants by at least 50 percent. Clearly, the regulations will not result in significant pollution reduction, however, since the regulations do not force manufacturers to implement their plans. 
Which of the following, if true, most weakens the argument? 
(A) Mullentown's manufacturing plants are not the only source of pollution there. 
(B) Detailed plans would reveal that measures to reduce released pollutants would also reduce manufacturers' costs for materials, waste disposal, and legal services 
(C) Pollutants that manufacturing processes create but that are not released directly into the environment must nonetheless be collected and prepared for disposal 
(D) Any reductions in pollutants released from Mullentown's manufacturing plants would not be noticeable for at least five years. 
(E) Each manufacturer will be required to submit its plan to a committee appointed by Mullentown's officials."	B
"To produce seeds, plants must first produce flowers. Two kinds of tarragon plants, Russian tarragon and French tarragon, look very similar except that Russian tarragon produces flowers and French tarragon does not. The leaves of Russian tarragon, however, lack the distinctive flavor that makes French tarragon a desirable culinary herb.
If the information presented is true, which of the following can most reliably be concluded on the basis of it? 
(A) As a decorative plant, French tarragon is more desirable than Russian tarragon. 
(B) The flowers of Russian tarragon plants are probably not flavorful. 
(C) Plants that grow from seeds sold in a packet labeled ""tarragon"" are not French tarragon. 
(D) There are no other kinds of tarragon besides Russian tarragon and French tarragon 
(E) Garden plants that have flavorful leaves generally do not produce flowers."	C
"In the United States, the financing of industrial research by private industrial firms remained steady as a percentage of sales during the period between 1968 and 1978 (after correcting for inflation). But slowdowns in the growth of industrial productivity also occurred during that period, a fact that refutes the notion that the growth of industrial productivity is directly proportional to the amount invested in industrial research. 
Which of the following, if true for the United States, most weakens the argument above? 
(A) Federal funds, which constituted a significant portion of the support for industrial research from 1968 to 1978, fell annually and substantially during that period. 
(B) The inflation that occurred between 1968 and 1978 was more severe than leading economists had expected. 
(C) Industrial executives generally favor investing an appreciably larger portion of corporate funds in short-term product development than in basic research. 
(D) The scientists and engineers who worked in industry from 1968 to 1978 were, as a group, more experienced in their jobs than were those who worked in industry during the previous ten-year period. 
(E) Corporate financing of industrial research increased in several of the years immediately following 1978 (after correcting for inflation)"	A
"Although many brands of gasoline are sold on Haibei Island, gasoline companies there get all of the refined gasoline they sell from Haibei seaport's only storage tank, which is always refilled with the same quality of gasoline. Therefore, the brands of gasoline of sale on Haibei may be different in name and price, but they are identical in quality. 
The conclusion drawn above depends on which of the following assumptions? 
(A) Consumers are usually unaware of variations in the quality of the gasoline they buy unless those variations are announced by the gasoline companies. 
(B) When tankers make gasoline deliveries at Haibei's seaport, the storage tank on Haibei always receives the same quantity of gasoline as that in the preceding delivery. 
(C) There is a wide variation in the prices at which the different brands of gasoline on Haibei are sold. 
(D) If any gasoline company on Haibei alters the quality of its gasoline before sale, the other gasoline companies also use methods before sale that result in the same change in the quality of their gasoline . 
(E) The gasoline storage tank on Haibei is large enough to meet the needs of all of Haibei's different gasoline companies."	D
"A group of paintings made approximately 15,000 years ago in a cave in the Loire River valley in what is now France depicts a number of different animals. One of the animals depicted seems to resemble the chiru, a rare antelope of the Himalayas.
Which of the following, if true, best supports the hypothesis that in painting the animal that resembles a chiru the cave artist painted a chiru with which she or he was familiar? 
(A) There are numerous representations of imaginary animals in cave paintings of similar age. 
(B) Fossilized remains of a chiru, approximately 16,000 years old, have been found at the northern end of the valley.

(E) The antlers of the animal in the painting are longer than those of the mature Himalayan chiru."	B
"The ancient Greek playwright Euripides followed the established conventions of verse composition less rigorously at the end of his career than at the beginning. Since the lines from a recently discovered Euripidean play adhere to those conventions as rigorously as do lines from Euripides' early plays, the recently discovered play must have been composed early in Euripides’ career. 
Which of the following is an assumption made in the argument? 
(A) All of Euripides' plays were written in verse. 
(B) Euripides did not write any plays late in his career in which he imitated the style of his early plays. 
(C) Euripides grew increasingly unaware of the established conventions of verse composition as his career progressed. 
(D) Late in his career, Euripides was the only playwright of his day who consciously broke with the established conventions of verse composition. 
(E) Ancient playwrights tended to be less willing to violate certain conventions early in their careers than they were late in their careers."	B
"In the United States, average fuel efficiency of newly manufactured domestic cars, although remaining worse than that of newly manufactured imported cars, substantially improved between 1983 and 1988.

If the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true on the basis of them? 
(A) Average fuel efficiency of domestic cars manufactured after 1988 was better than that of imported cars manufactured before 1988. 
(B) Average fuel efficiency of newly manufactured domestic cars has steadily worsened since 1988.

(E) Average fuel efficiency of imported cars manufactured in 1983 was better than that of imported cars manufactured in 1988."	C
"Between 1970 and 1980, energy consumption by United States industry peaked and then declined, so that by 1980 total industrial use of energy was below the 1970 level even though total industrial output had grown substantially in the same period. Industry must have instituted highly effective energy conservation measures in those years to have achieved such impressive results. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the conclusion of the argument? 
(A) Many industries switched to the greatest extent possible from high-priced oil to lower-priced alternatives throughout the 1970's. 
(B) Total residential energy consumption was higher in the United States in 1980 than it had been in 1970 
(C) Many industrial users of energy had paid little attention to energy conservation prior to 1970.

(E) The industries whose production dropped sharply during the 1970's included a disproportionately large number of energy-intensive industries."	E
"Many people acquire software programs for their home computers by illegally copying those programs rather than purchasing them. People who own home computers must be making, on average, fewer illegal copies of software programs than before, however, since the average number of software programs that people purchase to use on their home computers has increased substantially over the past five years. 
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
(A) The number of home computers in use has increased substantially over the past five years. 
(B) Five years ago, about half of the software programs used on home computers had been illegally copied rather than purchased. 
(C) Most people who have home computers use their computers more frequently the longer they have them. 
(D) Few people who prefer to copy computer software programs illegally cannot copy the software programs they want because they have no acquaintances who have those software programs. 
(E) On average, people with home computers have the same number of software programs today as people with home computers did five years ago."	E
"From a newspaper editorial： Many people who are addicted to heroin will eventually attempt to overcome their addiction, principally for two reasons：the expense of maintaining a heroin addiction and the fear of arrest. If heroin were legalized and made available cheaply, as some people advocate, neither of these reasons would apply.
The considerations above can best serve as part of an argument that 
(A) legalizing the sale of heroin would cause the price of this drug to go down 
(B) making it easier for heroin addicts to obtain treatment for their addiction would encourage many heroin addicts to attempt to overcome their addiction 
(C) legalizing the sale of heroin would increase the number of crimes committed by heroin addicts to support their addiction 
(D) making heroin available legally and cheaply would make it less likely that heroin addicts will attempt to overcome their addiction 
(E) decreasing the severity of penalties for individuals who use heroin would not increase the number of new heroin addicts"	D
"Stem borers are insect pests that often ruin North American corn crops. On some other continents, crop damage by stem borers is controlled by a certain species of wasp. Since these wasps eat nothing but stem borers, importing them into North America will keep crop damage from stem borers under control without endangering other North American insect species. 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
(A) Corn is the principal food of stem borers that live on continents other than North America. 
(B) The wasps are capable of surviving in North America long enough to eat significant numbers of stem borers. 
(C) No wasp in North America is closely related to the species of wasp that eats stem borers. 
(D) On continent other than North America, the wasps control stem borers more effectively than does any other pest control measure. 
(E) Corn crops on continents other than North America are not damaged by any insect pests other than stem borers."	B
"In the country of Laurelia, legal restrictions on the sale of lock-picking equipment were relaxed ten years ago, and since then Laurelia's burglary rate has risen dramatically. Hence, since legally purchased lock-picking equipment was used in most burglaries, reintroducing strict limits on the sale of this equipment would help to reduce Laurelia's burglary rate.
Which of the following, if true, gives the strongest support to the argument? 
(A) Laurelia's overall crime rate has risen dramatically over the last ten years. 
(B) There is wide popular support in Laurelia for the reintroduction of strict limits on the sale of lockpicking equipment. 
(C) The reintroduction of strict limits on the sale of lock-picking equipment in Laurelia would not prevent legitimate use of this equipment by police and other public safety officials. 
(D) Most lock-picking equipment used in Laurelia is fragile and usually breaks irreparably within a few years of purchase. 
(E) The introduction five years ago of harsher punishments for people convicted of burglary had little effect on Laurelia's burglary rate."	D
"Salesperson：The picture tube is the central component of any television, and Picturesque televisions use the same high-quality picture tubes as those used in TruVue televisions. Since you pay a much lower price for a Picturesque, you pay a lower price for a television with the same picture quality when you buy a Picturesque instead of a TruVue.
Which of the following is an assumption that, if justified, would allow the conclusion of the salesperson's argument to be properly drawn? 
(A) TruVue televisions are much more widely advertised than are Picturesque televisions. 
(B) The picture quality of a television is determined solely by the quality of its picture tube. 
(C) A salesperson earns much less on the sale of each Picturesque television than on the sale of each TruVue television. 
(D) Many more Picturesque televisions are sold each year than TruVue television. 
(E) Picturesque televisions are assembled in the same factory that assembles TruVue televisions."	B
"In a recent film set in seventeenth-century Europe, the hero is seen doing the crawl, a swimming stroke not known in Europe before the 1920's.However, since moviegoers obviously are not experts in the history of swimming strokes, for most of the film's audiences this blunder clearly cannot have interfered with whatever sense of historical authenticity the film otherwise achieved. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument given? 
(A) The film was widely praised for being historically plausible, even though it portrayed many events that were not historically attested. 
(B) The scene that shows the film's hero doing the crawl is a rescue scene pivotal to the film's action, and parts of it are even shown a second time, in a flashback. 
(C) Makers of historical films, even of those set as recently as the nineteenth century, routinely strike compromises between historical authenticity and the need to keep their material accessible to a modern audience, as in the actors' speech patterns. 
(D) The crawl that European swimmers used in the 1920's was much less efficient and more awkward-looking than the crawl that is currently taught. 
(E) A slightly earlier film featuring an eighteenth century sea battle in Europe was ridiculed in numerous popular reviews for the historical lapse of showing a sailor doing the crawl in swimming to safety."	E
"The government of Pontran claims that Tor City, one of the six major cities in that country, is alone among Pontran's cities in having sustained strong job growth this year. Clearly, however, any job growth this year. Clearly, however, any job growth there must be purely imaginary; in fact, in Tor City and only there, more people are unemployed this year than were last year. 
The argument countering the government's claim depends on the assumption that： 
(A) unemployed workers in Pontran did not, in significant numbers, move to Tor City when the government claimed Tor City had strong job growth 
(B) the unemployment rate in Tor City is higher year than in any previous year 
(C) actions taken by the government of Pontran significantly affect the unemployment rate in Tor City 
(D) the unemployment rate in Tor City, though increased, is still the lowest of any city in Pontran 
(E) there is no significant seasonal variation in the unemployment rate for Pontran as a whole"	A
"As people age, the number of calories they need each day decreases while their daily requirement of vitamin B6 increases. Clearly, unless older people take B6 supplements or eat a diet that contains more B6 than did the diet they ate when they were young adults, there is little likelihood that they will get B6 in needed amounts.
Which of the following would be most helpful to know to evaluate the argument? 
(A) Whether the relative decrease in the daily requirement of calories is greater than the relative increase in the daily requirement of vitamin B6. 
(B) Whether the form of vitamin B6 found in dietary supplements is more readily absorbed and utilized by the body than is the form of this vitamin that is found in food. 
(C) Whether the consequences of not getting vitamin B6 in required daily amounts are more serious for older people than for young adults. 
(D) Whether the diets of most people, when they are young adults, include vitamin B6 in amounts far in excess of their daily needs. 
(E) Whether the diets of older people are more likely than those of young adults to include one or more meals a day that are devoid of foods containing vitamin B6."	D
"The Environmental Protection Agency must respond to the hazard to children's health posed by exposure to asbestos fibers released in the air in school classrooms. Since it is impossible to close school buildings, the best plan would be to initiate programs that mandate the immediate removal of asbestos from all the school buildings that are found to contain asbestos, regardless of whether or not the buildings are in use. 
Which of the following, if true, is the strongest reason for the Environmental Protection Agency not to follow the plan outlined above? 
(A) The techniques available for removing asbestos often increase the level of airborne asbestos. 
(B) Schools are places where asbestos is especially likely to be released into the air by the action of the occupants. 
(C) Children exposed to airborne asbestos run a greater risk of developing cancer than do adults exposed to airborne asbestos. 
(D) The cost of removing asbestos varies from school to school, depending on accessibility and the quantity of asbestos to be removed. 
(E) It is impossible to determine with any degree of certainty if and when construction materials that contain asbestos will break down and release asbestos fibers into the air."	A
"Aedes albopictus, a variety of mosquito that has recently established itself in the southeastern United States, is less widespread than the indigenous swamp mosquito. Both the swamp mosquito and A. albopictus can carry viruses that are sometimes fatal to humans, but A. albopictus is a greater danger to public health. 
Each of the following, if true, provides additional information that strengthens the judgment given about the danger to public health EXCEPT: 
(A) Unlike the swamp mosquito, A. albopictus originated in Asia, and larvae of it were not observed in the United States before the mid1980's. 
(B) Unlike the swamp mosquito, A. albopictus tends to spend most of its adult life near human habitation. 
(C) Unlike swamp mosquito larvae, A. albopictus larvae survive in flower pots, tin cans, and many small household objects that hold a little water. 
(D) In comparison with the swamp mosquito, A. albopictus hosts a much wider variety of viruses known to cause serious diseases in humans. 
(E) A. albopictus seeks out a much wider range of animal hosts than does the swamp mosquito, and it is more likely to bite humans."	A
"A person's cholesterol level will decline significantly if that person increases the number of meals eaten per day, but only if there is no significant increase in the amount of food eaten. However, most people who increase the number of meals they eat each day will eat a lot more food as well. 
If the statements above are true, which of the following is most strongly supported by them? 
(A) For most people, cholesterol level is not significantly affected by the amount of food eaten per day. 
(B) For most people, the amount of food eaten per meal is most strongly affected by the time of day at which the meal is eaten. 
(C) For most people, increasing the number of meals eaten per day will not result in a significantly lower cholesterol level. 
(D) For most people, the total amount of food eaten per day is unaffected by the number of meals eaten per day. 
(E) For most people, increasing the number of meals eaten per day will result in a significant change in the types of food eaten."	C
"A certain type of dinnerware made in Ganandia contains lead. Lead can leach into acidic foods, and Ganandians tend to eat highly acidic foods. However, the extreme rarity of lead poisoning in Ganandia indicates that the dinnerware does not contain dangerous amounts of lead. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above? 
(A) The dinnerware is produced exclusively for sale outside Ganandia. 
(B) Ganandian foods typically are much more acidic than foods anywhere else in the world. 
(C) The only source of lead poisoning in Ganandia is lead that has leached into food. 
(D) Most people who use the dinnerware are not aware that it contains lead. 
(E) Acidic foods can leach lead from dinnerware even if that dinnerware has a protective coating."	A
"Sergeant: Our police academy no longer requires its applicants to pass a physical examination before being admitted to the academy. As a result, several candidates with weak hearts and high blood pressure have been admitted. Hence, we can expect our future police force to have more health problems than our current police force. 
Knowledge of each of the following would be relevant to determining the reliability of the sergeant's prediction EXCEPT whether 
(A) police officer candidates are screened for high blood pressure before joining the police force 
(B) the police officer candidates who are not healthy now are likely to be unhealthy as police officers 
(C) graduates of the police academy are required to pass a physical examination 
(D) the health of the current police officer candidates is worse than was the health of police officer candidates in the past 
(E) a police officer's health is a reliable indicator of the officer's performance"	E
"Because adult iguanas on Plazos Island are much smaller than adult iguanas of the same species on nearby islands, researchers assumed that environmental conditions on Plazos favor the survival of relatively smaller baby iguanas (hatchlings) in each yearly brood. They discovered instead that for each of the past three years, 10 percent of the smaller and 40 percent of the larger hatchlings survived, because larger hatchlings successfully evade their predators. 
Which of the following, if true about Plazos but not about nearby islands, contributes most to an explanation of the long-standing tendency of iguanas on Plazos to be smaller than those of the same age on nearby islands?
(A) Periodic wind shifts cause extended dry spells on Plazos every year, putting the larger iguanas, whose bodies require relatively more water, at a great disadvantage. 
(B) There are exactly three species of iguanas on Plazos but only two species of seagulls that feed on iguanas, and a relatively small percentage of each year's hatchlings are consumed by seagulls. 
(C) Wild cats, which were introduced as pets by early settlers and which were formerly major predators of Plazos iguanas, were recently killed off by a disease specific to cats. 
(D) The iguanas on Plazos are a relatively ancient part of the island's animal life. 
(E) Both land and marine iguanas live on Plazos, and the land iguanas tend to be larger than marine iguanas of the same age."	A
"Every human being who has ever lived had two parents. Therefore, more people were alive three thousand years ago than are alive now. 
The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it 
(A) overlooks the number of people in each generation during the last three thousand years who left no descendants 
(B) disregards possible effects of disasters such as famines and plagues on human history 
(C) overestimates the mathematical effect of repeated doublings on population size 
(D) fails to take into account that people now alive have overlapping sets of ancestors 
(E) fails to consider that accurate estimation of the number of people alive three thousand years ago might be impossible"	D
"Each of the academic journals Thought and Ergo has a review committee to prevent misattributed quotations from appearing in its published articles. Nevertheless, about ten percent of the quotations in Thought's published articles are misattributed, whereas Ergo contains no misattributions. Ergo's committee is more effective, therefore, than Thought's at finding misattributed quotations. 
The argument above assumes that 
(A) most of the articles submitted to Thought for publication contain misattributed quotations 
(B) there are at least some misattributed quotations in articles submitted to Ergo for publication 
(C) the members of Ergo's committee are, on the whole, more knowledgeable than are the members of Thought's committee 
(D) the number of misattributed quotations in a journal is an accurate measure of how carefully that journal is edited 
(E) the authors who submit articles to Ergo for publication are more thorough in attributing quotations than are the authors who submit articles to Thought"	B
"In the last few decades, grassy wetlands, essential to the nesting and breeding of ducks, geese, swans, and most other species of waterfowl, have been extensively drained and cultivated in southern Canada and the northern United States, Duck populations in North American have plummeted during this time, but populations of swans and geese have been affected less dramatically. 
Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference mentioned above? 
(A) Prohibition of hunting of waterfowl is easier to enforce in areas under cultivation than in wild lands. 
(B) Most geese and swans nest and breed farther north than ducks do, in areas that still are not cultivated. 
(C) Land that has been harvested rarely provides food suitable for waterfowl. 
(D) Goose and swan populations decline in periods of drought, when breeding sites are fewer. 
(E) Because they are larger than ducks, geese and swans have a harder time finding protected nesting sites in areas that are cultivated."	B
"A researcher found that, in proportion to their body weights, children eat more carbohydrates than adults do. Children also exercise more than adults do. The researcher hypothesized that carbohydrate consumption varies in direct proportion to the calorie demands associated with different levels of exercise. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the researcher's hypothesis? 
(A) More carbohydrates are eaten per capita in nations where the government spends more per capita on public exercise programs. 
(B) Children who do not participate in organized sports tend to eat fewer carbohydrates than children who participate in organized sports. 
(C) Consumption of increased amounts of carbohydrates is a popular tactic of runners preparing for long-distance races. 
(D) Periods of physical growth require a relatively higher level of carbohydrate consumption than otherwise. 
(E) Though carbohydrates are necessary for the maintenance of good health, people who consume more carbohydrates are not necessarily healthier."	D
"Experts removed a layer of eighteenth-century red paint from a figure in a painting by a sixteenth-century Italian artist, revealing a layer of green paint underneath. Since the green paint dates from the sixteenth century, the figure must have been green, not red, when the painting was completed in 1563.Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? 
(A) The experts had been commissioned to restore the painting to the colors it had when it was completed. 
(B) X-rays reveal an additional layer of paint beneath the green paint on the figure. 
(C) Chemical analyses were used to determine the ages of the red paint and the green paint. 
(D) The red paint was added in the eighteenth century in an attempt to repair damage done in the late seventeenth century. 
(E) Red paint on the robe of another figure in the painting dates from the sixteenth century."	B
"Although it is assumed that peacocks' magnificent tails function essentially to attract peahens, no one knows why it should be magnificent tails that give a competitive advantage in securing mates. One explanation is that peahens are more likely to mate with peacocks with magnificent tails than with peacocks that lack magnificent tails. 
Which of the following is an error of reasoning exemplified by the explanation? 
(A) Attributing to animals qualities that are characteristically human 
(B) Extending a conclusion that is true of only one species of a genus to all species of the genus 
(C) Offering as an explanation a hypothesis that in principle can be neither verified nor proved false 
(D) Offering the phenomenon that is to be explained as the explanation of that phenomenon 
(E) Assuming without warrant that peacocks with magnificent tails are likely to have other features strongly attractive to peahens"	D
"Whenever a French novel is translated into English, the edition sold in Britain should be in British English. If the edition sold in Britain were in American English, its idioms and spellings would appear to British readers to be strikingly American and thus to conflict with the novel's setting.
The recommendation is based on which of the following assumptions? 
(A) The authors of French novels are usually native speakers of French. 
(B) A non-British reader of a novel written in British English will inevitably fail to understand the meanings of some of the words and idioms in the novel. 
(C) No French novel that is to be sold in Britain in English translation is set in the United States. 
(D) A British reader of a British novel will notice that the idioms and spellings used in the novel are British. 
(E) Most French novels are not translated into both British English and American English."	C
"Auditor from Acme Industries: Last week at Acme Bakery, about six percent of the pastries baked during the night shift were found to be imperfect, but no imperfect pastries were found among those baked during the day shift. Pastries are inspected during the same shift in which they are baked, so clearly the night-shift quality control inspectors were more alert, despite their nighttime work hours, than the dayshift quality control inspectors. 
The argument depends on the assumption that 
(A) at least some imperfect pastries were baked during the day shift at Acme Bakery last week 
(B) not all of the pastries that the night-shift quality control inspectors judged to be imperfect were in fact imperfect 
(C) the night-shift quality control inspectors received more training in quality control procedures than did the day-shift quality control inspectors 
(D) in a normal week, fewer than six percent of the pastries baked during the night shift at Acme Bakery are found to be imperfect 
(E) there are only two shifts per day at Acme Bakery, a day shift and a night shift"	A
"Spiders of many species change color to match the pigmentation of the flowers they sit on. The insects preyed on by those spiders, unlike human beings, possess color discrimination so acute that they can readily see the spiders despite the seeming camouflage. Clearly, then, it must be in evading their own predators that the spiders’ color changes are useful to them. 
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
(A) Among the animals that feed on colorchanging spiders are a few species of bat, which find their prey through sound echoes. 
(B) Certain animals that feed on color-changing spiders do so only sparingly in order to keep from ingesting harmful amounts of spider venom. 
(C) Color-changing spiders possess color discrimination that is more acute than that of spiders that lack the ability to change color. 
(D) Color-changing spiders spin webs that are readily seen by the predators of those spiders. 
(E) The color discrimination of certain birds that feed on color-changing spiders is no more acute than that of human beings."	E
"Which of the following most logically completes the argument below? Each year every employee of SAI Corporation must enroll in one of the two health insurance plans offered by SAI. One plan requires a sizable monetary contribution from employees; the other plan is paid for entirely by SAI. Many SAI employees enroll in the plan requiring employee contributions. This fact does not show that they feel that this plan’s benefits are superior to those provided by the plan requiring no employee contribution since----. 
(A) the plan that requires an employee contribution costs and enrolled employee significantly less per year than do typical health insurance plans offered by corporations other than SAI 
(B) only SAI employees who have worked for SAI for at least fifteen years are eligible to enroll in the plan paid for entirely by SAI 
(C) the two health insurance plans currently offered by SAI are substantially the same plans SAI has offered for the past ten years 
(D) most of the SAI employees enrolled in the plan paid for entirely by SAI are under 50 years old 
(E) both plans offered by SAI provide benefits not only for employees of SAI but also for children and spouses of enrolled employees"	B
"V-shaped walled structures in central Asia were used by prehistoric hunters who drove hoofed animals into an enclosure at the point of the V. The central Asians who built these structures probably learned this hunting technique from invaders from southwest Asia, because the arrival of invaders from a region in southwest Asia where similar structures had long been used coincides roughly with the building of the earliest of such structures in central Asia. 
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
(A) Excavations in the central Asian region do not indicate whether invaders from southwest Asia settled permanently in central Asia. 
(B) The V-shaped structures in central Asia were roughly 70 meters long, whereas the similar structures in southwest Asia were usually over 300 meters long. 
(C) The walls of the structures in central Asia were made from earth, whereas the walls of the structures in southwest Asia were made of rock. 
(D) The earliest examples of V-shaped walled structures in central Asia were of an advanced design.

"Which of the following most logically completes the argument? Virtually all respondents to a recent voter survey reported allegiance to one of the two major political parties. But over a third of the voters from each party reported being so disenchanted with the governing philosophies of both parties that they might join a third major party if one were formed. Even if this poll reflects general voter sentiment, however, there is no chance that a new party could attract a third of all voters, since----. 
(A) the current level of disenchantment with the governing philosophies of the two major parties is unprecedented 
(B) the disenchanted members of the two major parties are attracted to very different governing philosophies 
(C) most respondents overestimated the proportion of voters disenchanted with both parties, saving that the proportion was more than 50 percent

(E) any new party would be likely to inspire citizens who have not voted before to join and to become regular voters"	B
"When amphibians first appeared on Earth millions of years ago, the amount of ultraviolet radiation penetrating Earth’s atmosphere was much greater than it is today. Therefore, current dramatic decreases in amphibian populations cannot be the result of recent increases in ultraviolet radiation penetrating Earth’s atmosphere. 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
(A) The eggs of modern amphibians are not significantly more vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation than the eggs of the first amphibians were. 
(B) Modern amphibians are not as likely as the first amphibians were to live in habitats that shield them from ultraviolet radiation.

"Chris: Hundreds of traffic accidents annually are attributable to the poor condition of our city’s streets. The streets must therefore be repaired to save lives. 
Leslie: For less than the cost of those repairs, the city could improve its mass transit system and thus dramatically reduce traffic congestion, which contributes significantly to those traffic accidents. The city cannot afford to do both, so it should improve mass transit, because reduced traffic congestion has additional advantages. 
Which of the following best describes the point at issue between Chris and Leslie? 
(A) Whether a certain problem in fact exists 
(B) How a certain problem came into being 
(C) Who is responsible for addressing a certain problem

"According to ancient records, the first tax that the government of Selea imposed on a basic commodity was a tax of two centima coins on every jar of cooking oil sold in Selea. Tax records show that despite a stable population and strict enforcement of tax laws, revenues from the oil tax declined steeply over the first two years that the tax was in effect. 
Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the decline in Selean oil-tax revenues? 
(A) During the decade following the implementation of the tax, the average household income in Selea rose steadily. 
(B) Two years after implementing the tax on cooking oil, the Selean government began to implement taxes on numerous other basic commodities. 
(C) Jars of cooking oil were traditionally bought as wedding gifts in Selea at the time the tax went into effect, and gifts of cooking oil increased after the implementation of the tax. 
(D) After the tax was imposed., Selean merchants began selling cooking oil in larger jars than before.

"Housing construction materials give off distinctive sounds when exposed to high temperatures. Acoustic sensors accurately detect such sounds and fire alarms incorporating acoustic sensors can provide an early warning of house fires, allowing inhabitants to escape before being overcome by smoke. Since smoke inhalation is the most common cause of fatalities in house fires, mandating acoustic-sensor-based alarms instead of smoke detectors will eliminate house fire as a major cause of death. 
Which of the following, if true, most weakens the argument given? 
(A) The present high cost of acoustic-sensorbased alarm systems will decline if their use becomes widespread. 
(B) When fully ignited, many materials used in housing construction give off sounds that are audible even from several hundred yards away. 
(C) Many fires begin in cushions or in mattresses, producing large amounts of smoke without giving off any sounds. 
(D) Two or more acoustic-sensor-based alarms would be needed to provide adequate protection in some larger houses. 
(E) Smoke detectors have been responsible for saving many lives since their use became widespread."	C
"In December 1992 Tideville Shopping Mall repaired and improved the lighting in the mall’s parking lots, and in 1993 car thefts and attempted car thefts from those lots decreased by 76 percent from the previous year. Since potential car thieves are generally deterred by good lighting, the decrease can be attributed to these improvements. 
Which of the following, if true, most helps to strengthen the argument above? 
(A) Both in 1992 and in 1993, most of the cars stolen from the mall’s parking lots were relatively new and expensive luxury models. 
(B) Most of the cars that were stolen from the mall in 1992 were stolen between 11 A. M. and 4 P.M. 
(C) Tideville Shopping Mall is one of only three shopping malls in the Tideville area.

(E) In 1993 the number of security officers patrolling the mall’s parking lots at night was doubled."	D
"Legislator: We should not waste any more of the taxpayers’ money on the government’s job-creation program. The unemployment rate in this country has actually risen since the program was begun, so the program has clearly been a failure. 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the legislator’s argument depends? 
(A) The budget of the job-creation program has typically increased every year. 
(B) The unemployment rate would not have risen even more than it has if the jobcreation program had not been in existence. 
(C) The unemployment rate is higher now than at any time before the inception of the job-creation program. 
(D) If the job-creation program had been run more efficiently, it could have better served its purpose.

"Which of the following most logically completes the argument? Each year a consumer agency ranks all domestic airlines for on-time performance during the previous year, using as its sole criterion the percentage of each airline’s flights that left no more than fifteen minutes late. The agency does not count delays due to mechanical reasons, but the fact that the percentage of delayed flights hat were delayed for mechanical reasons was approximately the same for all domestic airlines last year means that ----- . 
(A) including delays for mechanical reasons in calculating the airline rankings for ontime performance would have had little, if any, effect on last year’s rankings 
(B) airlines would work harder to reduce delays if delays for mechanical reasons were included in the determination of ontime performance rankings 
(C) the agency’s rankings do not give consumers an accurate idea of how a given airline compares to other airlines with respect to the percentage of flights delayed last year 
(D) those airlines with the best on-time performance record last year also had the greatest number of delays for mechanical reasons

"Pollutants in the atmosphere can cause acid rain (rain with high acidity levels). While acid rain in itself cannot significantly affect the acidity of bodies of water into which it falls, it can greatly increase the acidity of nearby lakes by increasing the amount of decaying matter on a forest floor. A recent increase in the acidity of the water in Forest Lake, therefore, surely indicates that the rain falling nearby has become more acid. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? 
(A) Even in areas without significant amounts of acid rain, most lakes in regions with vegetation similar to the vegetation around Forest Lake have acidity levels higher than those of other lakes. 
(B) Recent air-quality tests in the region around Forest Lake have revealed a slight increase in the amount of pollutants in the air. 
(C) Large-scale logging, which was recently begun in the forest surrounding Forest Lake, has increased the amount of decaying matter on the forest floor. 
(D) There is some disagreement among scientists about exactly how pollutants in the atmosphere cause acid rain. 
(E) Decaying matter exists on all forest floors and is an important factor in maintaining the healthy growth of the forests."	C
"Most of Earth’s surface is ocean. The ocean floor is inaccessible for extensive research without equipment of greater technological sophistication than is currently available. It must therefore be true that scientists know less about the ocean floor environment than about almost any other environment on Earth.
Which of the following, if true, provides the most support for the conclusion? 
(A) Many mountain ranges lie entirely beneath the ocean surface, yet new underwater surveying equipment has produced three-dimensional charts of them that are as accurate as those available for mountain ranges on land. 
(B) Strong water currents circulate on the ocean floor, but the general pattern of their movement is not so well understood as is the pattern of air currents that circulate over land. 
(C) In contrast to most land environments, temperature conditions at the ocean floor are generally stable and uniform, since sunlight does not penetrate far below the ocean surface. 
(D) Very few people have seen detailed maps of extended regions of the ocean floor, even though such maps are available in almost all large libraries. 
(E) Animals living on the ocean floor must be able to withstand water pressure that is far greater than the atmospheric pressure with which land animals live."	B
"At the Shadybrook dog kennel, all the adult animals were given a new medication designed to reduce a dog’s risk of contracting a certain common infection. Several days after the medication was administered, most of the puppies of these dogs had elevated temperatures. Since raised body temperature is a side effect of this medication, the kennel owner hypothesized that the puppies’ elevated temperatures resulted from the medication’s being passed to them through their mothers’ milk. 
Which of the following, if true, provides the most support for the kennel owner’s hypothesis? 
(A) Some puppies have been given the new medication directly but have not suffered elevated temperatures as a side effect. 
(B) The new medication has been well received by dog breeders as a safe and effective way of preventing the spread of certain common canine infections. 
(C) None of the four puppies in the kennel who had been bottle-fed with formula had elevated temperatures. 
(D) an elevated temperature is a side effect of a number of medications for dogs other than the new medication administered at the kennel. 
(E) Elevated temperatures such as those suffered by most of the puppies in the kennel rarely have serious long-term effects on a puppy’s health."	E
"Which of the following most logically completes the argument? 
Alivia’s government has approved funds for an electricity-generation project based on the construction of a pipeline that will carry water from Lake Cylus, in the mountains, to the much smaller Lake Tifele, in a nearby valley. The amount of electricity generated will be insufficient by itself to justify the project’s cost, even if the price of imported oil-Alivia’s primary source of electricity-increases sharply. Nonetheless, the pipeline project is worth its cost, because —— 
(A) the price of oil, once subject to frequent sharp increases, has fallen significantly and is now fairly stable 
(B) the project could restore Lake Tifele, which is currently at risk of drying up and thus of being lost as a source of recreation income for Alivia 
(C) the government of Alivia is currently on excellent terms with the governments of most of the countries from which it purchases oil 
(D) it would cost less to generate electricity by moving water from Lake Cylus to lake Tifele than to do so by moving water from Lake Cylus to another valley lake 
(E) Alivian officials do not expect that the amount of electricity used in Alivia will increase substantially within the next ten years"	D
"Amusement rides at permanent fairgrounds are dismantled once a year for safety inspections by independent consultants. Traveling fairs, which relocate each month, can slip past the net of safety inspections and escape independent inspection for several years. Therefore, the rides at traveling fairs are less safe than the rides at permanent fairs. 
Which of the following, if true about traveling fairs, most seriously weakens the argument? 
(A) Before each relocation, the operators dismantle their rides, observing and repairing potential sources of danger, such as worn ball bearings. 
(B) their managers have less capital to spend on the safety and upkeep of the rides than do managers of permanent fairs. 
(C) Since they can travel to new customers, they rely less on keeping up a good reputation for safety. 
(D) While they are traveling, the fairs do not receive notices of equipment recalls sent out by the manufacturers of their rides. 
(E) The operators of the rides often do not pay careful attention to the instructions for operating their rides."	B
"When cut, the synthetic material fiberglass, like asbestos, releases microscopic fibers into the air. It is known that people who inhale asbestos, fibers suffer impairment of lung functions. A study of 300 factory workers who regularly cut fiberglass showed that their lung capacity is, on average, only 90 percent of that of a comparable group of people who do not cut fiberglass. 
The statements above, if true, most strongly support which of the following hypotheses? 
(A) People who work with fiberglass are likely also to work with asbestos. 
(B) Fiberglass fibers impair lung function in people who inhale them. 
(C) Fiberglass releases as many fibers into the air when cut as does asbestos. 
(D) Coarse fibers do not impair lung function in people who inhale them. 
(E) If uncut, fiberglass poses no health risk to people who work with it."	B
"Politician: Pundits claim that by voting for candidates who promise to cut taxes, people show that they want the government to provide fewer services than it has been providing. By that reasoning, however, people who drink too much alcohol at a party in the evening want a headache the next morning. Which of the following could replace the statement about people who drink too much without undermining the force of the politician's argument? 
(A) People who spend more money than they can afford want the things they spend that money on. 
(B) People who seek different jobs than they currently have do not want to work at all. 
(C) People who buy new cars want to own cars that are under manufacturer's warranty. 
(D) People who decide to stay in bed a few extra minutes on a workday morning want to have to rush to arrive at work on time. 
(E) People who buy lottery tickets want the economic freedom that winning the lottery would bring."	D
"Like most other coastal towns in Norway, the town of Stavanger was quiet and peaceful until the early 1960's, when it became Norway's center for offshore oil exploration. Between then and now, violent crime and vandalism in Stavanger have greatly increased. Stavanager's social problems probably resulted from the oil boom, since violent crime and vandalism have remained low in coastal towns in Norway that have had no oil boom. 
Which of the following most accurately describes the method of reasoning employed in the argument? 
(A) Arguing that a circumstance is not a precondition for a phenomenon on the grounds that the phenomenon sometimes occurs where the circumstance is not present 
(B) Arguing that a circumstance is a cause of a phenomenon on the grounds that the phenomenon has not occurred where the circumstance is not present 
(C) Arguing that a particular thing cannot have caused a phenomenon because that thing was not present before the phenomenon occurred 
(D) Attempting to establish a claim by arguing that the denial of the claim is inconsistent with the observed facts 
(E) Attempting to establish that certain circumstances that would have had to occur for a particular explanation to be correct could not have occurred"	B
"Excavations at a Mayan site have uncovered jewelry workshops located some distance from the center of the site on roads radiating outward from the center. Since the nobility lived only in the area of the center, archaeologists conclude that these workshops made jewelry, not for the nobility, but for a middle class that must have been prosperous enough to afford it. 
The archaeologists' argument assumes which of the following about the artisans who worked in the workshops' 
(A) They were themselves prosperous members of a middle class. 
(B) They lived near their workshops. 
(C) Their products were not made from the same materials as was jewelry for the nobility. 
(D) They worked full-time at making jewelry and did not engage in farming 
(E) They did not take the jewelry they had made in the workshops to clients who were members of the nobility."	E
"Over the last 40 years there has been a great increase not only in the number of agricultural pesticides in use but also in the care and sophistication with which they are used by farmers. Nevertheless, the proportion of agricultural crops lost to certain pests worldwide has increased over the same period, even when the pests concerned have not developed resistance to existing pesticides. 
Which of the following, if true. best explains how improvements in pesticide use have been accompanied by greater losses to certain pests? 
(A) Some dangerous but relatively ineffective pesticides common 40 years ago are no longer in widespread use. 
(B) As pesticides have become increasingly pestspecific, controlling certain pests with pesticides has turned out to cost more in many cases than the value of crop losses caused by those pests. 
(C) Because today's pesticides typically have more specific application conditions than did pesticides in use 40 years ago, today's farmers observe their fields more closely than did farmers 40 years ago. 
(D) Certain pest-control methods that some farmers use today do not involve the use of chemical pesticides but are just as effective in eliminating insect pests as those that do. 
(E) Forty years ago, much less was known about the effects of pesticides on humans and other mammalian species than is now known."	B
"Authorities in California required drivers to use their headlights on a certain road during the daytime as well as at night and found that annual accident rates on the road fell 15 percent from the previous level. They concluded that applying the daytime rule statewide would lead to a similar reduction in accidents. 
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the authorities' argument? 
(A) Because an alternate route became available, the volume of traffic on the test road decreased during the test period. 
(B) Drivers were informed of the requirement to use their headlights on the test road by means of a series of three conspicuous signs in each direction of travel. 
(C) Under certain conditions, among them fog and heavy rain, most drivers in California already use their headlights during the daytime. 
(D) Full-scale application of the daytime rule would cause headlight bulbs to burn out sooner than they currently do and thus to require more frequent replacement. 
(E) The test road was selected to include a great variety of the sorts of road conditions that drivers in California are likely to encounter."	A
"Which of the following, if true, most logically completes the passage? Every fusion reaction releases neutrinos. To test a hypothesis about the frequency of fusion reactions in the Sun, physicists calculated the number of neutrinos the Sun would produce annually if the hypothesis were correct. From this they estimated how many neutrinos should pass through a particular location on Earth. The fact that far fewer neutrinos were counted than were predicted to pass through the location would seem to prove that the hypothesis is wrong, except that------. 
(A) the physicists, using a different method for estimating how many neutrinos should reach the location, confirmed their original estimate 
(B) there are several competing hypotheses about the frequency of solar fusion reactions 
(C) there is not enough energy in the Sun to destroy a neutrino once it is released 
(D) the method used to count neutrinos detects no more than approximately ten percent of the neutrinos that pass through 
(E) neutrinos released in the fusion reactions of other stars also reach the Earth"	E
"An economist concluded that Kregg Company deliberately discriminated against people with a history of union affiliation in hiring workers for its new plant. The economist's evidence is that, of the 1,500 people hired to work at the new plant, only 100 had ever belonged to a labor union, whereas in Kregg Company's older plants, a much higher proportion of workers have a history of union affiliation. 
Which of the following is an assumption on which the economist's argument depends? 
(A) None of the people with a history of union affiliation who were hired to work at the new plant were union organizers. 
(B) Applicants for jobs at the new plant were not asked by Kregg's recruiters whether they had ever belonged to a labor union. 
(C) In the plants of some of Kregg's competitors, the workforce consists predominantly of union members. 
(D) The company believes that the cost of running the new plant will be lower if labor unions are not represented in the workforce. 
(E) The pool of potential candidates for jobs at the new plant included some people, in addition to those Kregg hired, with a history of union affiliation."	D
"Hastings’ contracture is a disorder of the connective tissue in one or both hands, most commonly causing loss of mobility. A survey of thousands of medical-insurance claims found that over 30 percent of people who had one hand operated on for Hastings' contracture underwent surgery a second time for this disorder within three years. Clearly, therefore, a single surgical treatment of Hastings' contracture is often ineffective at providing long-term correction of the disorder. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? 
(A) The medical-insurance claims did not specie whether the surgery was on the patient's right or left hand. 
(B) The surgical techniques used to treat Hastings' contracture are identical to those used successfully to treat certain work-related injuries to the hand. 
(C) A separate survey found that 90 percent of patients operated on for Hastings' contracture report increased hand mobility within one month after the surgery. 
(D) All of the patients in the survey were required by their insurance companies to seek a second opinion from a qualified surgeon before undergoing the operation. 
(E) Many people who have Hastings' contracture choose to tolerate its effects rather than undergo the risks of surgery."	D
"The most widely used therapy for a certain type of ulcer completely heals such ulcers in 44 percent of patients within six months. In a six-month trial of a new therapy for this type of ulcer. 80 percent of ulcers treated achieved significant healing and 61 percent were completely heated. Since the trial treated only ulcers of this type that were worse than average, the new therapy clearly promotes healing more effectively than the most widely used therapy. 
The answer to which of the following would be most useful in evaluating the argument given? 
(A) What differences are there, if any, in the ways that the two therapies are administered? 
(B) Is there any significant difference between the costs associated with the two therapies? 
(C) What percentage of people with ulcers of this type who were treated with the most widely used therapy for six months experienced significant healing? 
(D) How quickly do ulcers of this type, if left untreated, become significantly worse. 
(E) What percentage of patients involved in the six-month trial of the new therapy were disappointed at the rate of healing were experiencing?"	C
"A society can achieve a fair distribution of resources only under conditions of economic growth. There can be no economic growth unless the society guarantees equality of economic opportunity to all of its citizens. Equality of economic opportunity cannot be guaranteed unless a society's government actively works to bring it about.

(E) some societies that experience economic growth fail to guarantee equality of opportunity to all of their citizens"	C
"High Towers, a company that occupies several office buildings, is considering installing new energy-efficient lightbulbs in its buildings. The new bulbs require less than half the electricity consumed by the conventional bulbs currently used to produce the same amount of light. The new bulbs also last considerably longer. It follows that by replacing old bulbs as they bum out with the new kind of bulb, High Towers would significantly reduce its overall lighting costs.
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument given? 
(A) If the new bulbs are widely adopted, as seems likely, they will be produced in large enough quantities to be offered at prices comparable to those of conventional bulbs. 
(B) The utility that supplies High Towers with electricity offers discount rates to its largest customers. 
(C) High Towers has recently signed a contract to occupy an additional small office building. 
(D) High Towers has begun a campaign to encourage its employees to turn off lights whenever they leave a room. 
(E) The company that manufactures the new bulbs has been granted a patent on the innovative technology used in the bulbs and thus has exclusive rights to manufacture them."	A
"The painter Peter Brandon never dated his works, and their chronology is only now beginning to take shape in the critical literature. A recent dating of a Brandon self-portrait to 1930 is surely wrong. Brandon was 63 years old in 1930, yet the painting shows a young, dark-haired man-obviously Brandon, but clearly not a man of 63. 
Which of the following, if justifiably assumed, allows the conclusion to be properly drawn? 
(A) There is no securely dated self-portrait of Brandon that he painted when he was significantly younger than 63. 
(B) In refraining from dating his works, Brandon intended to steer critical discussion of them away from considerations of chronology. 
(C) Until recently, there was very little critical literature on the works of Brandon. 
(D) Brandon at age 63 would not have portrayed himself in a painting as he had looked when he was a young man. 
(E) Brandon painted several self-portraits that showed him as a man past the age of 60."	D
"Dance critic from Europe: The improved quality of ballet in the United States is the result of more Europeans' teaching ballet in the United States than ever before. I know the proportion of teachers who were born and trained in Europe has gone up among ballet teachers in the United States, because last year, on my trip to New York, more of the ballet teachers I met were from Europe-born and trained there -than ever before. 
Which of the following identifies a questionable assumption made by the dance critic's reasoning? 
(A) The argument overlooks the possibility that some ballet teachers in the United States could have been born in Europe but trained in the United States. 
(B) The argument assumes that the ballet teachers whom the critic met last year on the critic's trip to New York were a generally typical group of such teachers. 
(C) The argument assumes that the teaching of ballet in the United States is superior to the teaching of ballet in Europe 
(D) Other possible reasons for the improved mental attitudes of United States dancers are not examined. 
(E) The argument assumes that dancers born and trained in Europe are typically more talented than dancers born and trained in the United States."	B
"Mayor Four years ago when we reorganized the city police department in order to save money, critics claimed that the reorganization would make the police less responsive to citizens and would thus lead to more crime. The police have compiled theft statistics from the years following the reorganization that show that the critics were wrong. There was an overall decrease in reports of thefts of all kinds, including small thefts. 
Which of the following, if true, most seriously challenges the mayor's argument? 
(A) When city police are perceived as unresponsive, victims of theft are less likely to report thefts to the police. 
(B) The mayor's critics generally agree that police statistics concerning crime reports provide the most reliable available data on crime rates. 
(C) In other cities where police departments have been similarly reorganized, the numbers of reported thefts have generally risen following reorganization. 
(D) The mayor's reorganization of the police department failed to save as much money as it was intended to save. 
(E) During the four years immediately preceding the reorganization, reports of all types of theft had been rising steadily in comparison to reports of other crimes."	A
"It takes a particular talent to be a successful business manager. Business courses can help people to solve management problems, but such courses can do so only for those people with managerial talent. Such people should take business courses to acquire ideas that they can subsequently use to good advantage if management problems happen to arise. 
If the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true on the basis of them? 
(A) People who are helped by business courses in solving management problems also have managerial talent. 
(B) People who are already skilled at solving management problems are unlikely to benefit from business courses. 
(C) Most ideas that are used successfully in solving management problems are those acquired in business courses.

(E) Those people who have never taken business courses are unable to solve management problems when such problems arise."	A
"When a driver is suspected of having had too much to drink, testing the driver's ability to walk a straight line gives a more reliable indication of fitness to drive than does testing the driver's blood-alcohol level. 
Which of the following, if true, best supports the claim made in the statement above? 
(A) Not all observers will agree whether or not an individual has succeeded in walking a straight line. 
(B) Because of genetic differences and variations in acquired tolerance to alcohol, some individuals suffer more serious motor impairment from a given high blood-alcohol level than do others. 
(C) Tests designed to measure blood-alcohol levels are accurate, inexpensive, and easy to administer. 
(D) More than half the drivers involved in fatal accidents have blood-alcohol levels that exceed the legal limit, whereas in less-serious accidents the proportion of legally intoxicated drivers is lower. 
(E) Some individuals with high blood-alcohol levels are capable of walking a straight line but are not capable of driving safely."	B
"That sales can be increased by the presence of sunlight within a store has been shown by the experience of the only Savefast department store with a large skylight. The skylight allows sunlight into half of the store, reducing the need for artificial light. The rest of the store uses only artificial light. Since the store opened two years ago, the departments on the sunlit side have had substantially higher sales than the other departments. 
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
(A) On particularly cloudy days, more artificial light is used to illuminate the part of the store under the skylight. 
(B) When the store is open at night, the departments in the part of the store under the skylight have sales that are no higher than those of other departments. 
(C) Many customers purchase items from departments in both parts of the store on a single shopping trip. 
(D) Besides the skylight, there are several significant architectural differences between the two parts of the store. 
(E) The departments in the part of the store under the skylight are the departments that generally have the highest sales in other stores in the Savefast chain."	B
"To protect beachfront buildings from ocean storms, ocean resorts have built massive seawalls between beaches and the buildings. Not only do the seawalls block off some buildings' ocean view, but the beaches themselves become ever narrower, because sand can no longer creep inland as storms erode it at the water's edge. 
If the information is correct, which of the following conclusions is most strongly supported on the basis of it? 
(A) Since the ferocity of ocean storms is increasing, increasingly high seawalls must be built between beaches and beachfront property. 
(B) Even when beaches are heavily used by people, they are necessary to the survival of the many wild species that use them. 
(C) Seawalls constructed to protect beachfront buildings will not themselves eventually be damaged by storms and will not require, if they are to protect the buildings, expensive repair or replacement. 
(D) The conservation of beaches for future generations should be the overriding goal of shore management at ocean coasts. 
(E) Trying to protect beachfront buildings by constructing seawalls is counterproductive in the long run for an oceanfront community wishing to maintain itself as a beach resort."	E
"A study found that 70 percent of children surveyed in 1970 had at one time had cavities, whereas only 50 percent of those surveyed in 1985 had ever had cavities. The researchers concluded that the level of dental disease in children had declined between 1970 and 1985. 
Which of the following, if true, would most seriously undermine the researchers' conclusion presented above? 
(A) Cavities are the most common kind of dental disease to which children are subject. 
(B) The children surveyed came from a broad variety of income backgrounds. 
(C) The children surveyed were selected from among students of teachers cooperating with the researchers.

"David: Since attempting to preserve every species that is currently endangered is prohibitively expensive, the endangered species whose value to humanity is the greatest should be accorded the highest priority for preservation. 
Karen: Such a policy would he unsound because it is impossible to predict the future value of a species, nor is it always possible to assess the present value of species whose contributions to humanity, though significant, are indirect.
Which of the following is the main point of Karen's reply to David? 
(A) Although it would be desirable to preserve all endangered species, doing so is not economically feasible. 
(B) Even if the value to humanity of a given species is known, that value should not be a factor in any decision on whether to expend effort to preserve that species. 
(C) Species whose contributions to humanity are direct should have a higher priority for preservation efforts than species whose contributions to humanity are only indirect. 
(D)Since the methods for deciding which species have the most value to humanity are imperfect, informed decisions cannot be made on the basis of the assessment of such value. 
(E) The preservation of endangered species whose value to humanity can be reliably predicted is more important than the preservation of species whose value for humanity is unpredictable."	D
"Roger: Reading a lot as a child causes nearsightedness-difficulty seeing things at a distance. 
Louise: I disagree. Any correlation between near-sightedness and reading results from the fact that children who have trouble seeing things at a distance are likeliest to prefer those activities, such as reading, that involve looking at things close up. 
Louise disputes Roger's claim by 
(A) demonstrating that an absurd conclusion would follow if Roger's claim were accepted 
(B) arguing that what Roger claims to be a cause of a given phenomenon is actually its effect

(A) The Parkville Department of Recreation confiscated abandoned bicycles and sold them at auction to any interested Parkville residents. 
(B) Increased automobile and bus traffic in Parkville has been the leading cause of the most recent increase in automobile accidents. 
(C) Because of the local increase in the number of people bicycling for recreation. many out -of -town bicyclists ride in the Parkville area.

(E) The Parkville Department of Transportation canceled a program that required all bicycles to be inspected and registered each year."	D
"Do strong electric currents, by means of the electromagnetic fields that accompany them, cause cancer in people who live and work nearby? Telephone line workers. who work near such currents every day, can provide a test case. They show elevated levels of brain cancer, therefore, the hypothesis of electromagnetic causation is supported. 
Which of the following if true, most seriously weakens the argument? 
(A) Burying power lines and other measures to protect the public from such electromagnetic fields would be prohibitively expensive. 
(B) Telephone line workers are exposed to levels of chemical solvents high enough to cause brain cancer. 
(C) High exposure to strong electromagnetic fields is correlated with a slightly higher-than-normal incidence of childhood leukemia, which is a form of cancer. 
(D) Public health officials who found that a group of different illnesses in people living near a power substation could not reliably be attributed to its electromagnetic field were accused of covering up the facts. 
(E) Telephone line workers, like most people. have electrical appliances at home, and most electrical appliances, when turned on, are surrounded by and electromagnetic field of some measurable level."	B

Beforehand. the delegations of Daqua and Kephria. allies whose governments had grievances against Tessia. officially announced that one or both of the two would stay away if the Tessian delegation attended the conference. In response, the Sami delegation officially announced that it would definitely attend if both the Daquan and Kephrian delegations stayed away.

"On turning 65 years old, everyone living in the town of Malton becomes eligible to receive a card that guarantees discounts on most goods and services sold in the town. Census records for 1990 show that 2, 450 inhabitants of Malton turned 64 in that year. Yet . in 1991 over 3,000 people applied for and properly received discount cards. So clearly some of Malton's population growth between 1990 and 1992 must be attributable to migration into the city by people in their mid -60's
Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
(A) The town of Malton has no complete census records for 1991. 
(B) The overall size of the population of Malton grew by over 500 during 1990. 
(C) Fewer people applied for and received discount cards in 1991 than did so in 1992.
