"Ms Walker would like to investigate whether drinking milk with lunch makes any difference to her students’ results in a times tables test. She decides to do an experiment. 
She splits her class into two groups according to their birthdays. For one whole month, students who were born between January and June are given milk with their lunch, and students who were born between July and December are given juice. 
After one month she gives the whole class a times table test. On average, the students who drank milk with lunch score five marks better than the students who drank juice.
Ms Walker: “So it’s true then − drinking milk with lunch improves children’s ability to remember the times tables!”

"Scrub jays are a species of bird that will bury some of the nuts they collect in order to save some food for later. Scientists studying the species made an interesting discovery: 
 1. Some scrub jays move nuts they bury if they see other scrub jays watching them bury the nuts the first time. 
 2. It is only those scrub jays who have previously stolen nuts from other scrub jays that move their nuts.
Logan: “That means a scrub jay must be able to predict which other scrub jays will steal its nuts.”

A The first word of the original message might not actually be ‘the’.
